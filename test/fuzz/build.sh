# The library is header-only and hardware-free, so each target is ONE
# translation unit and there is nothing for PlatformIO to add. Requires clang
# with compiler-rt (libFuzzer). See README.md for the WSL invocation used on
# the development host — the Windows-side MinGW toolchain cannot do this
# (no clang, no libFuzzer).
