# `workers` (default: nproc) fans one target across cores via libFuzzer's own
# -jobs/-workers. Set it to 1 for a single-process run whose exec counts are
# directly comparable between targets — which is what the RFC-028 first-pass
# numbers in README.md were measured with.
#
# Corpus policy: each target fuzzes into ITS OWN work directory seeded from
# the committed corpus. The committed corpus is never written to by a run —
# fold new coverage back deliberately (see README.md).
