# Applied by FetchContent PATCH_COMMAND inside the ixwebsocket source dir on
# fresh population (idempotent via the marker string). Upstream's server
# handshake never echoes Sec-WebSocket-Protocol; RFC 6455 §4.2.2 requires it
# when the client requested one, and strict clients (browsers) hard-fail the
# connect without it. Valence Bench pins valence.v1, same as sim/valencesim.
#
# Vendored rather than pointed at sim/valencesim/cmake/PatchIXWebSocket.cmake:
# Valence Bench's own FetchContent population is a separate source tree (each
# sim has its own build/ directory), so sharing the file would only add a
# cross-directory dependency for no benefit.
