valence_soak.py -- Valence STABILITY / SOAK harness.

valence_probe.py answers "is the protocol correct?". valence_soak.py answers the
question that actually decides whether anyone keeps the plugin installed:
"does it stay up?".  It exists because the operator's #1 complaint about
ecosystem clients is *clients that bug out and drop*, and because we are
replacing the firmware's WebSocket transport (links2004/arduinoWebSockets ->
ESP32Async AsyncWebSocket).  A transport swap that is *assumed* better is a
regression waiting to happen; this tool produces the before/after evidence.

  Run it on the OLD firmware  -> baseline.
  Run it on the NEW firmware  -> comparison.
  Diff the two JSON summaries -> the claim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WIRE FORMAT: NOT REIMPLEMENTED HERE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every byte this tool puts on the wire comes from `valence_probe.py`, imported
as a module from the same directory.  Frame header, the SPEC 5.3 deterministic
CBOR profile, message builders, packed-STATE decoders and the registry
constants all live there, and duplicating them here would create exactly the
drift the registry-discipline rule exists to prevent.

  !! COUPLING NOTE: tools/valence_probe.py is currently GIT-IGNORED while
  !! this file is tracked.  A clean checkout therefore gets a valence_soak that
  !! cannot import its own wire layer.  The .gitignore already carries a note
  !! recommending the probe be tracked; this file makes that decision urgent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENARIOS (each individually selectable, or run as a suite)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  b2b     Back-to-back sessions, NO reboot between them.  MANDATORY
          verification pattern for any session-lifecycle change -- it is how the source-
          ownership teardown leak was caught (every earlier probe pass hid it
          because deploys rebooted the device between runs).
  rst     Abrupt death: SO_LINGER 0 -> close() sends a TCP RST mid-session.
          Exercises the 11.4 ownership teardown on the rude-death path, and
          proves a later client can still take the source.
  churn   Rapid connect/handshake/disconnect cycling.  Slot/heap churn.
  wedge   THE headline test.  A client completes the handshake, subscribes at
          a high rate, then STOPS READING its socket without closing it.  The
          TCP receive window goes to zero and the hub's next send has nowhere
          to go.  Under links2004 `sendBIN` is a SYNCHRONOUS BUSY-WAIT, so
          that send stalls the whole Valence service task -- and with it
          every other client's telemetry.  Two sub-modes:
            silent  wedged client sends nothing either (the firmware's
                    mute-then-evict sweep should reclaim it after ~2 s)
            chatty  wedged client keeps PINGing.  Nastier, and the realistic
                    one: ValenceWsTransport::pushRx() clears the send-stall
                    mute on ANY inbound byte, so a client that talks but never
                    listens re-arms the blocking write over and over.
          What is measured is not the wedged client -- it is the HEALTHY ones.
  stream  Streaming load: motion-input (0x2100) at rate while watchers watch.
          Default amplitude 0.0 == hold current position: full ingress path,
          zero machine motion (this device is shared; see --stream-amp).
  soak    N concurrent steady-state sessions for a long duration.  The plain
          "does it just stay up" test.  Any disconnect here is a FAILURE.

Throughout, two background monitors run for the WHOLE session:
  * HTTP monitor  -- GET /api/status on an interval.  This is the operator-
                     visible symptom ("the WebUI says unreachable"), measured
                     directly rather than inferred.
  * Log monitor   -- GET /api/log, de-duplicated, parsing the `[sys] heap
                     free=/min=/maxblock=/psram=` beacon for a heap trend, and
                     harvesting the firmware's own W/E lines as evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAILURE vs EXPECTED -- the harness is strict about this on purpose
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * A deliberate RST, a deliberate GOODBYE, or the firmware evicting a client
    we DELIBERATELY wedged: EXPECTED.  Not counted as a dropout.
  * A disconnect of a client that was reading its socket and sending
    keepalives: UNEXPECTED.  That is a dropout, and it is what we are hunting.
  * STATE `seq` gaps are NOT loss.  The hub bumps a channel's retained seq on
    every publish and paces sends at the granted rate, so a 60 Hz channel
    granted at 20 Hz legitimately steps +3.  Only seq REGRESSION or a repeat
    is a wire defect.  Loss/stall is measured as ARRIVAL GAPS instead.
