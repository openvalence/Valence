slopscope.py -- SlopScope, the motion-pipeline oscilloscope for SlopDrive-32.

WHAT IT IS FOR
    Graph the RAW COMMANDED INPUT arriving over SlopSync, scaled into the
    stroke window, against what the motion planner actually did with it. Three
    lines on one mm axis:

        ASKED     0x1100 raw_10um   -- the demand as it landed, pre-planning
        PLANNED   0x1100 tgt_10um   -- where SlopMotion is driving to
        ACHIEVED  0x1100 pos_10um   -- where the carriage actually is

    plus the planner's own current segment (plan-strip: start -> end over
    durationUs) drawn as the commanded envelope around the trace inside it,
    the velocity plane, and the engine's anomaly EVENTs marked on the time
    axis. That is the whole diagnostic vocabulary for FEEL questions: quintic
    shaping, Ruckig-guard fallbacks, chase lag, handoff bounding.

SAFETY GUARANTEE
    SlopScope connects as a `watch`-tier session and SUBSCRIBES ONLY. It never
    sends an INTENT, never publishes a STREAM, never carries a `publishes`
    wish in its HELLO, and therefore cannot command motion -- not by accident,
    not by flag. There is no code path in this file that builds an INTENT
    frame. Drive the machine with something else (the WebUI, a player, the
    probe's --stream/--segments) and watch it here.

RELATIONSHIP TO tools/slopsync_probe.py
    The probe is this project's primary verification client and stays
    untouched. SlopScope IMPORTS it as a wire library -- CBOR codec, frame
    header, message builders, registry constants, the CLOCK exchange, the
    send/recv plumbing -- so there is exactly one implementation of the
    SlopSync wire in tools/ and it is the heavily-exercised one. What
    SlopScope adds on top is a catalog-DRIVEN decoder: where the probe
    hardcodes struct layouts (correct for a conformance tool that must fail
    when the device drifts), SlopScope decodes every packed STATE payload from
    the catalog the hub just served it, so it follows an append-only layout
    change without a code edit.

DISCOVERY IS BY ROLE AND NAME, NEVER BY CHANNEL ID
    Nothing in this file hardcodes 0x1100/0x1000/0x1110/0x1111/0x4100 (RFC-047
    Phase C4; motion/machine-config/motion-anomaly never moved, plan-strip and
    slopmotion-diag did — see CHANNEL-MAP.md for the renumber). The
    stroke window is resolved by the registry field_roles `window.min` /
    `window.max`; the position/velocity fields by `telemetry.position` /
    `telemetry.velocity`; the rest by the catalog's own declared entry and
    field NAMES. See resolve_* below, and the `resolution` block written into
    every trace header -- a trace records HOW it found each thing, so a trace
    taken against a differently-numbered hub is still readable.

    Known gap, worth a registry PR one day: `tgt_10um` and `raw_10um` carry
    catalog descriptions but no field_role, so ASKED and PLANNED are resolved
    by field name (with the layout-order fallback described in
    resolve_motion). That is recorded honestly in the header rather than
    papered over.

USAGE
    python slopscope.py record  [--ip IP] [--port 82] [--seconds S] [--out T.jsonl]
                                [--render G.html]
    python slopscope.py live    [--ip IP] [--port 82] [--seconds S] [--out T.jsonl]
    python slopscope.py render  T.jsonl [--out G.html] [--theme dark|light]

    `record` captures a JSONL trace; `render` turns a trace into ONE
    self-contained HTML file (inline SVG + inline JS, zero network requests,
    zero dependencies -- it opens on a bench laptop with no internet);
    `live` prints a terminal dashboard while streaming and can record too.

REQUIREMENTS
    Python 3.8+, the `websocket-client` package (same as the probe). The
    RENDER path needs nothing at all -- stdlib only -- so a trace can be
    rendered anywhere.

# WHY HAND-ROLLED SVG AND NOT A PLOTTING LIBRARY
#   The output has to open on a bench laptop with no internet and no Python
#   environment, months later, and be e-mailable as one file. A CDN <script>
#   is out by the brief; a bundled JS charting library would be a vendored
#   dependency this repo would then own; a matplotlib PNG cannot be zoomed,
#   and would make the RENDER path depend on a package the record path does
#   not need. So: the page carries its data as JSON and draws itself with
#   ~200 lines of inline JS into inline SVG. Stdlib only, no network, no
#   fonts to fetch (system stacks), and it zooms.

# ---- palette ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Semantic, taken from the product's own tokens so an operator recognizes it
# instantly:
#   webui/src/style.css      --reality #4DA6FF (measured/achieved)
#                            --intent  #A78BFA (commanded/unconfirmed)
#                            --warn    #F5B94D / --bad #FF4757 (safety only)
#   docs-site .../datasheet.css  the light-ground re-tuning of the same pair
#
# PLANNED is the third line and the brief asked for a justified choice. It is
# drawn as a DEEPER STEP OF THE REALITY BLUE, not a new hue: the planner's
# target is the hub's ACCEPTED intent -- already through arbitration, clamping
# and the window, i.e. across the boundary and on reality's side. Same hue =
# same family; the lightness step says "accepted, not yet executed". It is also
# the color-blind-safest choice available, because lightness is the one
# channel every CVD type keeps.
#
# HONEST NOTE ON THE PRODUCT PALETTE (measured, not guessed -- ΔE in OKLab×100
# under Machado 2009 severity 1.0): #4DA6FF vs #A78BFA is ΔE 1.1 under
# deuteranopia and 11.4 under normal vision. The product's reality/intent pair
# is therefore NOT distinguishable by color alone. Recognition across the
# whole product is the requirement here, so the pair is kept -- and every
# series carries mandatory secondary encoding (its own dash pattern, a legend
# key drawn in that pattern, a direct end-label and a named crosshair readout).
# The `cvd` palette in the toolbar re-steps the same semantic families to a set
# that passes: light #7B4BE0/#0d7f5f/#14539e passes all six checks; dark
# #C4A0FF/#14A89A/#2E90E8 passes CVD, normal-vision, chroma and contrast.
