// valence-core — per-session subscription/grant table, SPEC §10.2 (grants
// as truth) and §9.1 (STATE push pacing/conflation).
//
// A SubscriptionTable is a session's set of ACTIVE grants: what the hub told
// this client it would deliver, at what ceiling rate, at what priority. It
// is the thing SUBSCRIBE/GRANT (wire/messages/subscribe.hpp, grant.hpp)
// negotiate INTO — this file has no wire dependency, no knowledge of the
// session engine that will call it, and does not send anything itself.
//
// ---- Conflation with zero queues --------------------------------------------
// Design note, ties together with retained_store.hpp.
//
// SPEC §9.1 describes conflation as "at most a depth-1 queue per (channel,
// subscriber) — a newer snapshot replaces a queued unsent one". This file
// does NOT implement a queue at all, depth-1 or otherwise, and does not
// store any channel VALUE — only the pacing decision. The value lives
// exactly once, hub-side, in retained_store.hpp's RetainedStore (one entry
// per STATE channel, not per subscriber). A subscriber "not yet due" simply
// means: when it next becomes due, it reads whatever RetainedStore::get()
// currently holds — which, by construction, is always the LATEST published
// value (RetainedStore has no history either). So "a newer snapshot
// replaces a queued unsent one" is true by the absence of a queue to be
// stale in, rather than by an explicit replace-if-present operation: there
// is nothing else it COULD read. retained store (single latest value) +
// per-subscriber pacing (this file) together give you depth-1 conflation
// with no queue anywhere in the picture.
//
// dueForPush()'s "changePending" input is owned by the caller (e.g. "does
// RetainedStore's seq for this channel differ from the seq last pushed to
// this subscriber" — a comparison this file deliberately doesn't make itself
// since it doesn't track per-subscriber last-seen seq; that bookkeeping is
// the session engine's, one layer up).
