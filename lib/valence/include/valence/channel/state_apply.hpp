// valence-core — the STATE shadow-apply function, SPEC §9.1/§7.3.
//
// STATE frames are idempotent full snapshots (§9.1): every frame carries the
// complete current value, so a shadow only ever needs to remember the LAST
// one it accepted. "Accepted" is decided purely by sequence number
// (§7.3's newest-wins rule), via util/serial_arithmetic.hpp's seqIsNewer —
// this file adds no inline seq comparison of its own.
//
// applyStateFrame() is deliberately dumb: it does not know or care what a
// channel's payload MEANS (that's wire/packed/layout_codec.hpp's job, or a
// compile-time struct's, downstream of the shadow). It only decides whether
// an incoming (seq, payload) pair should replace what's currently held —
// exactly the "conflation" behavior SPEC §9.1/§7.3 describe: an older or
// equal-seq frame is silently dropped, gaps are meaningless, and a frame
// that would overflow the fixed shadow buffer is rejected rather than
// truncated (silently accepting a truncated STATE snapshot would violate
// the "every STATE frame contains the complete current value" rule — better
// to keep the old, complete value than adopt a corrupt partial one).

// is exactly what catalog evolution looks like, and is legal by
// construction (§4.4: released fields never move, resize, or get removed).

// knownLayout.size() fields and never looks past them, so calling it
// with a prefix `knownLayout` against a longer `payload` (e.g. straight out
// of a ShadowSlot::value/size pair) IS the rule. This wrapper exists purely
// so call sites reading the known prefix out of whatever the hub actually
// sent say so by name, rather than re-deriving the reasoning inline at
// every call site.
//
// `knownLayout` is a field span — get one from cat.layoutFields(entry), and
// .first(n) it to model a client that only knows the first n fields.
