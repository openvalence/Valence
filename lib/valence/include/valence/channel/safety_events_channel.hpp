// valence-core — the spec-core SAFETY-EVENTS channel (0x000E).
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. §9.4's event/state duality rule names e-stop as THE canonical
// pair — "EVENT for the edge, `safety` 0x0003 for the latch" — and §5.5/§11.2
// both require the hub to "emit the EVENT twin". Until M4b there was nowhere to
// emit it: no EVENT channel and no kind existed anywhere in the registry, so
// handleEstopFrame() had never emitted one and neither had the RFC-010 client
// e-stop op that M4a deliberately routed through it rather than inventing a
// number. This channel is that missing half.
//
// WHY ITS OWN CHANNEL, and not kinds bolted onto session-events (0x0007):
//   * 0x0007 is a SESSION-LIFECYCLE vocabulary (join / leave / takeover) at
//     `normal` priority. Safety edges are a different domain with a different
//     urgency, and merging them would force the whole channel to `critical` —
//     making every join notification never-shed, which is exactly backwards.
//   * A client must be able to subscribe to safety edges WITHOUT also taking
//     every session churn event, and vice versa. One channel cannot express
//     two subscription decisions.
//   * The duality rule reads better when it is literally true: 0x0003 is the
//     latch, 0x000E is its edge, same domain, same `critical` priority, same
//     `watch` access. Nobody may be denied a safety edge and nobody's safety
//     edge may be shed.
//
// EMITTED ON TRANSITIONS ONLY. A repeated ESTOP frame re-broadcasts the STATE —
// that is §11.2's only loss-recovery mechanism and it must keep working — but
// it does NOT re-emit the edge. An edge that did not happen is a lie, and a
// client counting initiations would count wrong.
//
// Every event carries `seq_of_state` (34) naming the 0x0003 frame it
// corresponds to, which is what lets a client that missed the edge reconcile
// against the latch it DID receive.
