// valence-core — the HUB role (SPEC §2.2, §3.1, §6, §9, §10). One per
// machine. No threads: the owner calls update() from its loop (firmware:
// a Core-0 task; sim: the test harness). The hub NEVER touches application
// machinery directly — everything application-specific goes through
// HubDelegate, and on the firmware that delegate submits to the
// MotionArbiter (sole-caller doctrine, §3.1: normative).
//
// M4 scope note: liveness bookkeeping and the safety channel's ESTOP latch
// are implemented here (E-04 needs the latch as the acknowledgment, §11.2).
// M5 additions (this file): deadman policy dispatch (§11.3), source
// ownership + takeover (§11.4), congestion-driven shedding + slow-consumer
// eviction (§10.4), pairing (§12.2), and the network probe (§6.4).

    //
    // THE LATENCY PROBLEM, AND WHY THIS IS AN API AT ALL: on the S3 there is no
    // ECC accelerator (that peripheral is C3/C6/H2), so one mbedtls software
    // ECDSA sign is ~30-80 ms in ONE uninterruptible call. update() runs on a
    // 5 ms Core-0 tick that also paces STATE, runs the deadman, and drains the
    // motion-input ring — an inline sign would stall all of that for 6-16 ticks
    // EVERY time a client connects, i.e. one client's handshake would put a
    // visible hole in another client's motion stream. That is not a latency
    // nit; it is a defect.

    // The library is threadless by invariant, so it cannot own the deferral —

    //   CEILING — a tick's chunks share the link (and the same per-client TX
    //     queue) with the safety plane, STATE pacing and EVENT drain, and one
    //     update() must not do dramatically more work than another.

    // 8 chunks per tick on the firmware's 5 ms hub task is 1600 chunks/s

    // eighth of the gap timeout, two orders inside the abandon timeout, and

    // 8 x 206 B of payload (~1.7 KB framed), a quarter of the 32-deep TX queue
    // this bug was found against, so a transfer paces itself well below the
    // queue it shares instead of trying to own it.
    // 8 -> 2 (M5c). MEASURED, not tuned by feel: a bisect showed every Valence
    // session transiently borrows ~45-60 KB of heap, on a session whose steady
    // state costs about 1 KB, and that the WS plane owns it outright (450 HTTP
