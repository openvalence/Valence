// valence-core — the §10.4 shedding algorithm, expressed as one pure
// function. No I/O, no hub/session knowledge: shedDecision() only answers
// "given this subscription's priority and channel class, and the link's
// current congestion level, what happens to its next due push?" — wiring
// that decision into an actual pacing loop (decimation counters, ConflateHard
// stretching, Drop, slow-consumer eviction) is hub/hub_impl.hpp's job.
//
// RFC-023 (v1.0): THIS TABLE IS NORMATIVE. It was implemented from the M5
// milestone brief and was for a while "more prescriptive than SPEC §10.4's
// prose" — which meant two conforming hubs could shed differently under
// identical load and no client could predict either. It is now adopted as the
// reference behavior, segment exception included.
//
//   level 0 (clear):      everything -> Send.
//   critical priority:    always -> Send, at every level (§10.1 never-shed set).
//   level 1 (congested):
//     background + STREAM -> Decimate4x
//     background + STATE  -> ConflateHard (stretch periodic pushes toward on-change-only)
//     normal     + STREAM -> Decimate2x
//     elevated             -> Send (untouched)
//     anything else (background/normal on INTENT/EVENT, normal+STATE) -> Send
//       (INTENT is client->hub and never paced here; EVENT already has its
//       own bounded drop-oldest queue independent of congestion level,
//       §9.4 — this function's decimation vocabulary just doesn't apply to
//       either class, so "no additional shed" is the correct answer, not an
//       omission)
//   level 2 (stalled — never-shed queue itself can't drain):
//     background -> Drop (regardless of class)
//     normal     -> Decimate4x (regardless of class)
//     elevated   -> Decimate2x (regardless of class)
//     critical   -> Send (never-shed, see above)
//
//   SEGMENT-CLASS STREAM OVERRIDE (RFC-014/023, `segmentClass` argument):
//     NEVER Decimate/ConflateHard. The decisions collapse to Send or Drop —
//     "shed whole-source or not at all".
//       level 1                     -> Send   (mild congestion never justifies
//                                              losing an authored command)
//       level 2, background/normal  -> Drop   (whole-source shed)
//       level 2, elevated/critical  -> Send   (the level-2 slow-consumer
//                                              EVICTION clock is the backstop;
//                                              silently deleting motion
//                                              commands is not)
//
//   WHY: §9.2 justifies decimation with "timestamps make dropped samples
//   recoverable by interpolation". True for dense position samples; FALSE for
//   timed segments, where a dropped bundle is a permanently lost command and
//   its neighbors describe different intervals, not adjacent points on one
//   curve. Halving a segment stream does not halve its fidelity — it deletes
//   half the motion. See catalog.hpp's isSegmentClass() / the registry's
//   `stream_kind` catalog property (RFC-014/023) for how a hub decides which
//   channels these are: an explicit, registered property, not a unit-string
//   heuristic (the M5 heuristic let two conforming hubs disagree and was
//   struck by the feasibility pass).
