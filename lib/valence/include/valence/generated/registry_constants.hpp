Specified layout: generation u16 + count u8 + flags u8, then 8 packed slots {session_id u32, role u8, flags u8, name str16} = 8x22 + 4 = 180 B, inside the 242 B floor at default_max_clients_ws 8. The str16 name (feasibility pass) is intended to FIX the never-replayed-join-events blocker: a late joiner would learn existing sessions' names from the roster snapshot instead of missed 0x0007 events.

Declares a replay depth (log_replay_depth_default) so the hub MAY replay its ring tail on grant, the named exception to §9.4's no-replay rule.

Any `configure` session approves/denies via 0x0009 (session_admin_ops pair_approve/pair_deny); the joiner needs one button and no display. TWO FIELD CLARIFICATIONS made when M4b implemented this: `kind` is the `pairing_modes` BIT that produced the knock (1 knock_approve / 2 pin_proof / 4 push_to_pair), so an approving UI can say HOW the device asked; and the countdown is `expires_s`, NOT ms; pairing_window_default_s is 120, i.e. 120000 ms, which does not fit the u16 the slot layout allocates. Seconds is also the only resolution an approval UI can use. `flags` bit0 = a pairing association window is currently OPEN (RFC-027(c) push-to-pair), which is how window state stays observable in-band for a session that connected before the window opened.

Kinds in `safety_event_kinds`; fields ride the scoped `body` (40) sub-map keyed by this channel's own catalog schema (word, cause, owner_session, estop_seq, level). `critical` priority and `watch` access, matching its STATE twin exactly: an edge nobody is allowed to be denied and nobody is allowed to shed. Carries `seq_of_state` (34) naming the 0x0003 frame it corresponds to, which is what lets a client that missed the edge reconcile against the latch it DID receive. Emitted on TRANSITIONS ONLY: a repeated ESTOP frame re-broadcasts the STATE (that is §11.2's loss recovery) but does NOT re-emit the edge, because an edge that did not happen is a lie.

Grammar fix from the feasibility pass: with kind-specific fields at the top level, every device-authored EVENT channel (the motion-anomaly channel!) would have needed a registry PR to name its own fields: the precise coupling the self-describing catalog exists to prevent.

Clamped to rate x max_burst_multiple and echoed like every wish. Exists because §10.5 made rate double as bucket depth, so a 2-4/s segment sender with a 25/s peak had to declare 30 Hz: lying to admission control to buy burst.

The hub clamps into [deadman_min_ms, deadman_max_ms] (a hub MAY clamp tighter) and echoes the APPLIED value via the existing key 24, post-clamp echo, zero new response plumbing. Exists because a client that KNOWS its liveness cadence is coarse (a browser whose background-tab timers are throttled, a BLE client on a slow connection interval) could not ask for a window it can actually honor; §11.3's loss policy is untouched: this negotiates WHEN the deadman fires, never WHAT it does.
    curve_family = 45,  // uint: publishes / granted_publishes ENTRY maps: which `curve_families` smoothness class the segment stream describes (RFC-030). Wish rides HELLO or PUBLISH (0x18) like `burst`, so a sender switching interpolators mid-session renegotiates without a reconnect; the GRANT echo carries the EFFECTIVE family, post `curve_policy` override, so a client can tell 'honored' from 'downgraded'. Absent = unspecified = today's behavior. RFC-049b: `requested_curve_family` (48) rides the SAME entry map echoing the original wish verbatim, so the honored-vs-downgraded read is a direct comparison of two present keys, not an inference from what the client remembers sending.
    ws_port = 46,  // uint: WELCOME: the hub's own WebSocket listening port (RFC-046 §3). Present on every binding but load-bearing over BLE: it is the in-band endpoint disclosure a BLE-connected client needs to hop to WS (RFC-043's auto-upgrade). Also closes the sim's hub-identity gap for WS-side clients: the same key tells a WS client what the hub believes its own endpoint is. 0 = none (no WS listener right now).
    ipv4 = 47,  // uint: WELCOME: the hub's own IPv4 address (RFC-046 §3), packed big-endian into one u32 (e.g. 192.168.1.229 = 0xC0A801E5): there is no bstr(4) here because a plain integer makes '0 = none' the same natural sentinel 0.0.0.0 already is. Read alongside `ws_port` for the BLE→WS upgrade hop. 0 = none.
    requested_curve_family = 48,  // uint: publishes / granted_publishes ENTRY maps (RFC-049b): echoes the client's `curve_family` (45) WISH verbatim, unmodified by `curve_policy`. Exists alongside the existing effective value at key 45 so a downgrade is a visible FACT (both numbers present, compare them) rather than an inference a client has to reconstruct from what it originally sent. Present only when a curve_family wish was made; a hub with no curve-family opinion omits both keys exactly as before this RFC. Implementation: Phase D (RFC-049).

TWO DELIVERY POINTS, ONE MEANING: inline in WELCOME where a hub can sign without stalling its own tick, otherwise deferred in HUB_SIG once the hub's own low-priority worker has produced it.

    READY_TIMEOUT = 0x010A,  // session never sent CATALOG_READY within catalog_ready_timeout_ms (RFC-015, GOODBYE code). Needed because liveness reaping NEVER fires on a client that PINGs happily but never finishes adopting the catalog: it would hold a slot forever with both planes gated shut.
    NOT_READY = 0x010B,  // frame refused because the session has not sent CATALOG_READY yet (RFC-015). READY gates BOTH planes: pre-READY INTENTs are NACK'd, not queued, because a client acting before it has adopted the retained safety latch breaks §11.5(2).
    IDLE_REAPED = 0x010C,  // RFC-039.4: hub-initiated teardown of a NON-OWNING session that fell silent past idle_reap_multiplier x ping_interval_idle_ms (RFC-024, GOODBYE code). Distinct from DEADMAN_TIMEOUT on purpose: reaping a dark viewer is housekeeping with zero motion consequence, and before this code existed it was reported with the motion-safety code: a reaped dashboard read as a deadman event in every log and client. RFC-042: silence no longer reaches this code directly; it marks a session STALE instead (session_event_kinds.4), so the reference hub no longer emits DEADMAN_TIMEOUT or IDLE_REAPED for silence; both stay registered for a hub/policy combination that still wants to terminate outright.
    SLOT_RECLAIMED = 0x010D,  // RFC-042: a HELLO that would otherwise NACK BUSY instead evicted a STALE session to make room (lowest access tier first, tie-break longest continuously stale): best-effort GOODBYE code, since the reclaimed session was stale for a reason and may never receive it. Distinguishable from SESSION_EVICTED (admin kick only, since RFC-051) and from DEADMAN_TIMEOUT/IDLE_REAPED (which no longer fire for silence at all).
    UNKNOWN_CHANNEL = 0x0200,  // channel id not in catalog
    ACCESS_DENIED = 0x0201,  // channel access level above session role
    CLASS_MISMATCH = 0x0202,  // e.g. SUBSCRIBE to an INTENT channel
    SUB_LIMIT = 0x0203,  // per-session subscription cap reached
    SUBSCRIBE_REJECTED = 0x0204,  // RFC-033.2: the SUBSCRIBE frame as a WHOLE could not be processed (undecodable, or more wishes than max_subscriptions_per_frame): as opposed to the per-channel codes above, which reject one wish and grant the rest. `detail` carries the reason. Exists because the alternative was observed silence: a dropped SUBSCRIBE leaves a healthy-looking LIVE session with zero STATE, which presents as a client rendering bug and cost two debugging nights.
    CONFLICT = 0x0300,  // precondition (cfg_gen CAS) failed
    RATE_LIMITED = 0x0301,  // ingress intent rate exceeded
    INVALID_VALUE = 0x0302,  // outside schema min/max or wrong type; also a store import whose kind or size the hub refuses (RFC-021.5)
    UNSUPPORTED_OP = 0x0303,  // intent op not implemented on this hub
    ESTOP_ACTIVE = 0x0400,  // refused while e-stop latched
    NOT_HOMED = 0x0401,  // motion intent before homing
    INTERLOCK = 0x0402,  // hub-specific safety interlock
    SOURCE_CONFLICT = 0x0403,  // another session owns this arbiter source
    TAKEOVER_REQUIRED = 0x0404,  // control exists; retry with takeover flag
    CLEAR_REFUSED = 0x0405,  // e-stop clear conditions not met (§11.2)
    CHUNK_UNAVAILABLE = 0x0500,  // blob chunk index out of range, or a store/slot that does not exist WITHIN a registered namespace (generalized from 'catalog chunk' by RFC-021; the catalog is now namespace 0). An unregistered NAMESPACE itself is the more specific INVALID_NAMESPACE (0x0504, RFC-049e): this code no longer covers that case.
    REASSEMBLY_TIMEOUT = 0x0501,  // fragment reassembly abandoned (5 s)
    ETAG_MISMATCH = 0x0502,  // static-profile client etag != hub catalog etag
    BLOB_REFUSED = 0x0503,  // RFC-039.2: a RECEIVER refusing a declared blob (total_bytes over its reassembly budget), sent as a GOODBYE code by the client rather than idling in a half-session. The observed failure: a client's DoS-guard cap silently refused a grown catalog's transfer header and the session went LIVE WITH NO CATALOG: no error anywhere, every STATE frame undecodable, READY_TIMEOUT eventually killing it 15 s later and blaming the client. Refusal is legal; SILENT refusal is not.
    INVALID_NAMESPACE = 0x0504,  // RFC-049e: a BLOB_REQ naming a `blob.ns` value not in the registered `blob_namespaces` table (0 catalog / 1 store; 128-255 device-defined are legal too: only a value truly outside every registered/device range trips this). Split out of CHUNK_UNAVAILABLE so a client can tell 'namespace does not exist' from 'namespace exists, item does not' (§18-8's panel-flagged gap) instead of receiving the same code for both. Same range as its siblings because it is a transfer-request refusal, not a new error class. Implementation: Phase D.
