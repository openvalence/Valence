// valence-core — PING/PONG liveness frames, SPEC §6.5.
//
// Both are raw frames (frame type carries the meaning; there is no
// structure to a PING/PONG payload beyond "whatever bytes are there").
// "Any received frame is proof of life" (§6.5) — PING is the fallback sent
// only once a side has otherwise been silent for its interval (200 ms while
// holding active control, 1 s otherwise). In practice a PING carries an
// EMPTY payload; the spec nonetheless requires PONG to echo back whatever
// payload bytes the PING carried, so a future PING variant that adds a
// nonce/counter round-trips correctly without a wire-grammar change — §4.3's
// "unknown means ignore" already covers a receiver that doesn't understand
// extra PING payload bytes.
//
// There is deliberately no decode step here beyond taking the frame's
// payload as-is: PING/PONG payloads are opaque to this layer by design.
