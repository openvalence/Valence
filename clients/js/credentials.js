/**
 * credentials.js — how this client obtains the token it presents in HELLO.
 *
 * THE POINT OF THIS FILE: it is the ONLY difference between the WebUI the
 * device serves and the same WebUI inside a Tauri shell. Everything else —
 * every card, every intent, every renderer — is byte-identical between the two
 * builds. The shell supplies one function (`httpGet`) and, if it wants, a host;
 * that is the whole delta.
 *
 * ── The ladder (tried in order, first hit wins) ─────────────────────────────
 *
 *   1. STORED PAIRING TOKEN (identity.js). Durable, survives reboots on both
 *      ends, and is the ONLY rung that still works once the operator disables
 *      /uitoken. This is the real credential; the rest is bootstrap.
 *
 *   2. /uitoken MINT. A single-use, 60 s, control-tier token the device hands
 *      to anything that can HTTP GET it. See the honesty note below.
 *
 *   3. NOTHING. HELLO carries no token and the hub answers `watch`: the UI
 *      renders, telemetry flows, controls gray out, and the e-stop STILL WORKS
 *      (safety ops are role-exempt by catalog `option_access`, RFC-025b — the
 *      person standing next to the machine can always stop it). Degraded is a
 *      designed state here, not a failure.
 *
 * ── HONESTY ABOUT /uitoken ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The endpoint's only defense is the ABSENCE of CORS headers, which stops a
 * malicious *web page* in the operator's browser from reading the response. It
 * stops nothing else: `curl http://<device>/uitoken` works from anywhere on the
 * LAN and yields control tier. So while /uitoken is enabled, "authentication is
 * on" means *LAN trust, formalized* — every client presents a credential and
 * the hub has a real chokepoint — NOT "the machine is locked down". The lockdown
 * posture is /uitoken DISABLED plus paired tokens, and this ladder walks into
 * that posture without a code change: rung 2 simply stops answering and rung 1
 * carries everyone who paired.
 *
 * That is also exactly why rung 1 is tried FIRST rather than last. A paired
 * client should never spend a mint it does not need, and should never depend on
 * an endpoint the operator may have turned off.
 *
 * ── Tauri (the ~15 lines) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   import { fetch as tauriFetch } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-http';
 *   setHttpGet(async (url) => {
 *     const r = await tauriFetch(url, { method: 'GET' });   // Rust-side: no CORS
 *     return r.ok ? await r.text() : null;
 *   });
 *
 * The Rust-side fetch is not subject to browser CORS, so the shell gets the same
 * frictionless first-run the device-served page gets. If a shell would rather
 * force explicit pairing, it just does not call setHttpGet — rung 2 goes dark
 * and rung 1/3 behave correctly with no other change.
