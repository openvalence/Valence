# JavaScript client guide

!!! warning "This page is not written yet"

    It is a stub. It names what belongs here and where the source
    material is. It does not fake content.

    Content follows the v1.0 tag on purpose: the normative section must
    describe what shipped, not what was planned.

## What belongs on this page

The browser client. Cover `WebSocket` binary frames, the subprotocol, CBOR in the browser, and why optimistic interface state is prohibited.

Source material: `clients/js/`, this repo's own v1.0 reference
implementation (see the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md#javascript) for a
worked example), and `tools/valence_probe.py` for wire parity.

> DEMO-CANDIDATE: a live connect-and-subscribe walkthrough in the browser —
> HELLO to rendered STATE, one frame at a time.

## Every client guide covers the same seven things

Keep the order identical across languages, so a reader who knows one guide can
skim another.

1. Open the transport and complete the handshake.
2. Handle the catalog: fetch, cache by
   [etag](../../reference/dictionary.md#etag), or pin it.
3. Pass the [ready gate](../../reference/dictionary.md#ready-gate).
4. Adopt retained STATE before rendering anything.
5. Send an [intent](../../reference/dictionary.md#intent) and render the
   [echo](../../reference/dictionary.md#echo), never the request.
6. Keep the session alive, and honor the
   [deadman](../../reference/dictionary.md#deadman) if you own a source.
7. Handle NACKs, including the range fallback for a code you do not know.

## Where to go next

- [Quickstart](../quickstart.md) — the same seven steps, worked end to end.
- [Plugin guide](../plugins.md) — wiring a client into a host application.
- [CLI guide](../cli.md) — watch what your client did to the motion.
