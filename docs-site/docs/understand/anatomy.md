# Anatomy of a frame

Everything Valence sends is a [frame](../reference/dictionary.md#frame). A
frame is an eight-byte header followed by a payload.

This is the only page in this section that shows bytes. Read
[How it works](how-it-works.md) first; this page explains the envelope that
carries everything on it. The same colors apply: blue is measured truth,
purple is a request, amber and red are safety.

## 1. Four layers, four jobs

<p class="ss-cap" markdown>What each layer is responsible for, and what it deliberately knows nothing about.</p>

    classDef plumb fill:none,stroke:#8a8f98,stroke-dasharray:3 3
```

<p class="ss-point" markdown>**The point.** Everything above the binding line is transport-blind. A binding is four operations plus an honest declaration of what it can do, so adding a transport never changes the protocol above it.</p>

| Layer | Owns | Knows nothing about |
|---|---|---|
| Session | Who this client is, what it may do, what it was granted, how silence is detected | How bytes travel |
| Channel | What a class promises: a snapshot supersedes, a sample is one instant, a command is confirmed | Which transport carries it |
| Framing | Where a frame starts and ends, which channel it belongs to, its sequence number | What the payload means |
| Transport binding | Moving one frame, and declaring its own size limit, ordering and reliability | Anything about sessions or channels |

**The weakest transport writes the rules.** Every guarantee is stated against
unordered, lossy, 242-byte datagrams. Anything correct there is correct
everywhere, and a reliable transport simply gets stronger behavior for free.

## 2. Every frame starts the same way

<p class="ss-cap" markdown>The eight-byte header, byte by byte, and the payload that follows it.</p>

<div class="ss-bytemap">
<div class="ss-bytemap__scale" style="--cols:12" aria-hidden="true">
<span>0</span><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>4</span><span>5</span><span>6</span><span>7</span><span>8</span><span>9</span><span>10</span><span>+</span>
</div>
<div class="ss-bytemap__row" style="--cols:12">
<div class="ss-f ss-f--hdr" style="--span:1"><b>type</b><span>u8</span></div>
<div class="ss-f ss-f--hdr" style="--span:1"><b>flags</b><span>u8</span></div>
<div class="ss-f ss-f--hdr" style="--span:2"><b>channel</b><span>u16</span></div>
<div class="ss-f ss-f--hdr" style="--span:2"><b>seq</b><span>u16</span></div>
<div class="ss-f ss-f--hdr" style="--span:2"><b>len</b><span>u16</span></div>
<div class="ss-f ss-f--open" style="--span:4"><b>payload</b><span>len bytes</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="ss-point" markdown>**The point.** The header is the same eight bytes on every transport and for every frame type. A receiver can therefore skip a frame it does not understand instead of disconnecting, because the length is always in a place it can read.</p>

| Field | Size | Its job |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | 1 byte | Which kind of frame this is. The [frame type table](../reference/registry/frames.md) lists every one. |
| `flags` | 1 byte | Fragmentation marks. Unlisted bits are sent as zero and ignored on receipt. |
| `channel` | 2 bytes | Which catalog channel this belongs to. Session-scoped frames use zero. |
| `seq` | 2 bytes | The [sequence number](../reference/dictionary.md#sequence-number), per channel and per direction. Classes that do not need it send zero. |
| `len` | 2 bytes | Payload length. This is what makes a frame self-delimiting on a transport that is a byte pipe rather than a message queue. |

Three rules hang off this header, and together they are why an old client keeps
working against a new machine.

**Unknown means ignore.** An unknown frame type, an unknown channel, an unknown
key: skip it and carry on. No endpoint may disconnect or flood a log over
novelty. The sender of something new carries the burden of making it ignorable.

**One frame is one message** wherever the transport allows it. Fragmentation
exists only for large control frames on small-datagram transports. Data frames
never fragment.

**Emergency stop is deliberately different.** The stop frame is twelve bytes,
starts with a four-byte magic pattern, and carries a CRC. A receiver can
recognize it in a raw byte stream without decoding anything, which is what lets
every queue on the path admit it at the front. Its bytes are specified in
[the safety codes reference](../reference/registry/safety.md).

## 3. Two encodings, and why there are two

The header never changes. The payload is encoded one of two ways, and the
choice follows how often the frame is sent.

<p class="ss-cap" markdown>The same two numbers, encoded for the data plane and for the control plane.</p>

**Packed, on the [data plane](../reference/dictionary.md#data-plane).** One
motion sample: a target position and a velocity. No keys, no type tags, nothing
but values in the order the catalog declared.

<div class="ss-bytemap">
<div class="ss-bytemap__scale" style="--cols:4" aria-hidden="true">
<span>0</span><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span>
</div>
<div class="ss-bytemap__row" style="--cols:4">
<div class="ss-f ss-f--reality" style="--span:2"><b>target</b><span>u16</span></div>
<div class="ss-f ss-f--reality" style="--span:2"><b>velocity</b><span>i16</span></div>
</div>
</div>

**CBOR, on the [control plane](../reference/dictionary.md#control-plane).** The
same two numbers as a map. Each key is an integer from one registry, and each
value carries its own type.

<div class="ss-bytemap">
<div class="ss-bytemap__scale" style="--cols:8" aria-hidden="true">
<span>0</span><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>4</span><span>5</span><span>6</span><span>7</span>
</div>
<div class="ss-bytemap__row" style="--cols:8">
<div class="ss-f ss-f--intent" style="--span:1"><b>map(2)</b><span>1 byte</span></div>
<div class="ss-f ss-f--intent" style="--span:1"><b>key</b><span>target</span></div>
<div class="ss-f ss-f--intent" style="--span:3"><b>value</b><span>uint</span></div>
<div class="ss-f ss-f--intent" style="--span:1"><b>key</b><span>velocity</span></div>
<div class="ss-f ss-f--intent" style="--span:2"><b>value</b><span>negative int</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="ss-point" markdown>**The point.** Self-description costs bytes. A frame sent hundreds of times a second does not pay that cost, and a frame sent when somebody presses a button gladly does. Same numbers here: four bytes packed, eight as a map.</p>

| | Packed layout | CBOR map |
|---|---|---|
| Used by | STATE and STREAM — the data plane | Everything that negotiates, commands or confirms |
| Sent | Continuously, up to hundreds of times a second | Occasionally |
| Self-describing | No. The catalog's [layout](../reference/dictionary.md#layout) is the only reader | Yes. Every value carries its type, every key means one thing everywhere |
| Decoding cost | A field read at a known offset | A small parser, or a canned template on a device too small for one |
| Evolution | Append at the tail only. Old readers parse the prefix they know | Add a key. Old readers ignore what they do not recognize |

Both halves of that last row are the same promise made twice, which is the
reason for the split.

**A layout may only grow at the tail.** Fields are never reordered, resized or
removed. A client compiled a year ago still reads every field it knows from a
machine whose catalog has grown since. Changing a field means allocating a new
channel and retiring the old one, which keeps its number forever.

**A map may only gain keys.** A client that meets a key it has never seen skips
the pair. This is the same tolerance rule as the header's, applied one level
down.

One more restriction earns its keep. Valence uses a deterministic
[CBOR](../reference/dictionary.md#cbor) profile: definite lengths,
shortest-form integers, sorted keys, no tags. Any message therefore has exactly
one valid encoding. That is what lets test vectors compare byte for byte, and
what lets a client too small for an encoder ship a canned template and patch
values into it, knowing the bytes are what a real encoder would have produced.
