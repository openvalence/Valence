# Security model and the audit

## The threat model, in one paragraph

**The v1 model is casual and drive-by prevention on a trusted local network.**
It stops a device on your network from controlling your machine by accident or
on a whim. It does not pretend to stop a determined attacker who is already
inside that network with capture and injection tooling.

That sentence is the whole scope. Everything below either supports it or says
plainly where it stops.

The reason to be exact about it: on this product category, **unauthorized
control is a physical-safety issue**, not a privacy inconvenience. A model
that overstates itself is worse than a modest one, because people deploy
against what the documentation claims.

## What is defended

| Defense | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Casual and accidental control** | Watching is open. Anything that moves the machine needs a [token](../reference/dictionary.md#token) earned through a [pairing](../reference/dictionary.md#pairing) ceremony |
| **Cross-machine mix-ups** | A token binds to one machine and one [instance id](../reference/dictionary.md#instance-id). Two hubs in range never share credentials |
| **A wrong or stale client** | Roles are scoped per channel. A `watch` session cannot own a motion source, whatever it sends |
| **Privilege creep during approval** | An approver may grant up to its own tier and no further. Asking for more is refused, never silently reduced |
| **A device you no longer trust** | Revocation is protocol, from any `configure` session, and bites at that device's next handshake |
| **Invisible presence** | The [trust ledger](../reference/dictionary.md#trust-ledger) names every paired device, its tier and its token presentation mode; session-events broadcast joins and leaves as they happen |
| **A changed client** | An observed version change drops a paired device to recognized-pending. See the [change tripwire](../reference/dictionary.md#change-tripwire), and its honesty clause below |
| **Browser-borne attacks** | The [served-page token](../reference/dictionary.md#served-page-token) endpoint sets no cross-origin headers. A page from anywhere else can send the request and cannot read the answer |
| **Unauthenticated queue flooding** | Every queue a stranger can fill is bounded: the pending-pairing list, admission control, ingress [token buckets](../reference/dictionary.md#token-bucket), and slow-consumer eviction |
| **Protocol-level memory safety** | [Parser totality](../reference/dictionary.md#parser-totality) is a conformance obligation in both directions, and the [fuzz gate](../reference/dictionary.md#fuzz-gate) enforces it |
| **Losing the stop control** | `stop` and `estop` are role-exempt. Authorization can never take the stop away from the person in the room |
| **An evil twin machine** | An optional hub signature over client-supplied entropy. A clone copies every string and fails the signature |

Two of those deserve their reasoning stated, because they look like
inconsistencies until you see it.

**Safety outranks authorization.** Anybody may stop the machine; not everybody
may start it. A stop that required a credential would fail exactly when it
matters, which is the moment the person in the room needs it and has no
session.

**Watching is open by default.** Locking the view would push people toward
sharing one control credential, which is worse. A hub may still require a
token for viewing where the deployment calls for it.

## What is not defended

Stated without hedging.

- **An active attacker on your LAN.** Someone running capture and injection
  tooling on the same network is outside the model. They can observe, replay
  in the window before a nonce rotates, and interpose.
- **A native process on your LAN.** Any local program can request the
  served-page token, because same-origin policy binds browsers and nothing
  else. That attacker class already defeats the cleartext ceiling below, so
  the mechanism loses nothing to it and is capped at `control` anyway.
- **A passive sniffer on the wire.** v1 transports are cleartext. A bearer
  token in a handshake is readable by anyone watching the network. Proof
  presentation plugs the *credential theft* — a sniffer captures a one-time
  proof and never the secret — and it does not encrypt anything else.
- **Physical access.** Possession is root, deliberately. A factory-fresh hub
  boots claimable, and the power-cycle gesture re-opens pairing. That is a
  usability decision made in the open, and it is why factory reset must be a
  harder gesture than opening pairing.
- **Denial of service.** Someone in radio range can jam the radio. No protocol
  text changes that.
- **A malicious update to a paired client.** See the tripwire clause below.

### The honest ceilings

**The PIN proof is offline-brute-forceable, by design.** Four digits is ten
thousand HMACs. A passive observer of a pairing exchange can compute all of
them.

This is acceptable for the stated threat model, and
[the specification](../spec/index.md) states it plainly rather than implying
it away. It is also one reason
[knock-and-approve](../reference/dictionary.md#knock-and-approve) is the
recommended ceremony: its approval surface shows the knocker's identity on
hardware the attacker does not control. A password-authenticated key exchange
is the reserved upgrade. It is not in v1 because browsers have no such
primitive, and mandating one would exile the browser client.

**The version tripwire is a tripwire, not attestation.** The client version is
self-reported. It catches an honest update and asks you to re-approve it. A
deliberately malicious update reports whatever version it likes and keeps its
token. What actually bounds a hostile client is role scoping, immediate
revocation, trust-ledger visibility, and the fact that safety operations are
role-exempt for everyone.

**The protocol's ESTOP is not the hardware path.** It is fast, role-exempt,
latched and repeated until observed. It is still software on a network. The
hardware emergency-stop path remains the guarantee of last resort.

**Firmware update is outside this model entirely.** Update rights are never
derivable from any access tier, so a `configure` compromise cannot flash the
machine.

### Deployment rules that follow

1. **Never expose the Valence port to the wider internet.** LAN-first is a
   security property, not a limitation.
2. **Prefer knock-and-approve.** It needs no PIN and no display, and it shows
   you who is asking.
3. **Use proof presentation if your client can compute an HMAC.** Browsers,
   desktop apps and every ESP32 can. It costs one round trip.
4. **Keep `configure` rare.** It is the tier that approves other devices.
5. **Revoke devices you no longer use.** The trust ledger exists so that this
   is a thing you can actually do.

## The audit

None of what follows shipped. That is the point of doing it before the tag.

### The fuzz campaign

Every Valence parser must map *any* byte string to accept-or-reject. Golden
vectors prove correctness; fuzzing proves totality. Both directions are in
scope, because a client that auto-connects to a discovered machine is one
malicious hub away from parsing hostile bytes, and the catalog is the fattest
client-side surface in the protocol.

<div class="ss-facts" markdown>

| | |
|---|---|
| **Targets** | 7, one per parser surface: CBOR reader, catalog, frame and reassembly, packed layouts, stream bundles, blob transfer, and all control-plane decoders |
| **Executions** | 2,291,021,252 in the first campaign — 600 s per target, single worker each, so the counts compare |
| **Instrumentation** | libFuzzer with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, with undefined-behavior recovery disabled |
| **Result** | Zero crash, leak, timeout or out-of-memory artifacts after the three fixes below |
| **Seeds** | Generated by the library's own encoders, so the mutator starts inside the accepting region rather than bouncing off first-byte rejects |

</div>

Three memory-safety bugs were found and fixed, each with a regression test.

| # | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The CBOR reader's string handling | A length check computed `start + len`, which **overflows**. A header claiming 2⁶⁴−1 bytes wrapped the sum past the check and returned a view of that claimed length into a nine-byte buffer. Reachable from **every** message decoder, and from the skip-unknown-key path, which is an attacker's preferred entry point. This was the CVE-shaped one |
| 2 | The blob chunk reassembler | A transfer correctly **refused** for exceeding capacity still stored the attacker's numbers, and two later calls used them without checking whether the transfer was active. Refusing a transfer must refuse its numbers too, or the guard only moves the bug one call to the right |
| 3 | The fragment reassembler | One unbounded copy into a fixed buffer — the single write in the class that did not go through the bounds-checking path |

**The trap worth publishing:** finding 3 survived a 7.8-million-execution fuzz
run and was then found by hand. Its overflow lands in the very next member of
the same structure, and an intra-object overflow is invisible to
AddressSanitizer. Only a write long enough to leave the whole enclosing object
reports. Never conclude "the fuzzer would have caught it" for a bug between
two arrays of one struct.

### Two authorization gaps, found while building the trust ledger

Neither was reachable in a released build. Both were found by asking, during
implementation, who is allowed to do this.

**The blob transfer verb had no role check at all.** That was survivable while
the catalog was the only thing it could fetch. The catalog is client-invariant
and deliberately readable by anyone who can connect.

It stopped being survivable the moment a store could hold something that is
not public. The [trust ledger](../reference/dictionary.md#trust-ledger) is
`configure` access, and without a gate a `watch` session could have enumerated
every paired device on the machine. The fix is the rule subscription already
uses: the declaring catalog entry's access level is the floor. Every future
store inherits it. A store nobody declared answers "unavailable" rather than
"denied", so refusing tells an attacker nothing either way.

**A pairing knock could be filed under somebody else's identity.** Approval is
by instance id. A connected client could therefore queue a knock in another
device's name, and trick an operator into authorizing a stranger under a
familiar label. The fix is one comparison: a session may only knock for its
own instance id.

<p class="ss-point" markdown>**The point.** Publishing found-and-fixed defects is a credibility asset, not a confession. A protocol claiming a clean history is either very young or not telling you something. These were found before release, which is the entire reason to run the gate before the tag rather than after it.</p>

### What the gate does not cover

Stated plainly, so nobody reads a green run as more than it is.

- **Stateful protocol sequences.** The targets fuzz decoders and the two
  stateful reassemblers. They do not drive a hub and a client through session
  lifecycles, so session-lifecycle bugs are out of reach here. That class is
  covered by a manual pattern — see
  [Local testing](../build/local-testing.md).
- **Firmware transports.** The library boundary is where fuzzing stops.
  Whatever a transport adapter does to a buffer before it calls in is unproven
  by this gate.
- **Concurrency.** Single-threaded by construction.
- **Timing, rate limits and deadman policy.** Reachable in principle through a
  stateful harness; not attempted.
- **Semantic correctness.** Fuzzing says nothing about whether a decoded value
  is the *right* value. That is the golden vectors' job. The two are
  complements, not substitutes.

## Where to go next

- [Capabilities and custom hardware](capabilities.md) — pairing on hardware
  with no screen, no LED and no buttons.
- [Local testing](../build/local-testing.md) — run the harnesses, and the
  regression pattern that catches what fuzzing cannot.
- [Pairing modes](../reference/registry/pairing.md) — the generated table,
  including token presentation modes and trust states.
