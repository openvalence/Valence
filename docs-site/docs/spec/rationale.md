# Appendices H-J: rationale and history

## Appendix H — Design rationale and rejected alternatives *(informative)* {#appendix-h}

**Stacks evaluated and not adopted.**

- **On-device MQTT broker:** available brokers ignore retained messages and wills and offer QoS 0 only — the device-shadow primitive would be rebuilt application-side anyway; transports are TCP-shaped; licensing was hostile. The glue equaled this document's hard parts with none of its fit.
- **zenoh-pico:** runs on the target but peer-unicast nodes do not route (no hub role on-device); no datagram-radio or browser-server transport; custom-transport API unresolved upstream.
- **MQTT-SN:** the gateway side has no MCU implementation, and reference gateways are host programs that themselves need an upstream broker.
- **Micro XRCE-DDS:** the Agent (the hub role) is host-only. Its transport abstraction was adopted ([§13.1](transports.md#s13-1)); the stack was not.
- **ThingSet:** the best conceptual match, but the node library is RTOS-bound, the radio binding is unlisted, and subscription-rate negotiation does not exist. Its self-describing data model was adopted in spirit ([§8](catalog.md#s8)).
- **Matter:** ~1.5 MB flash and ~195 KB RAM before application logic; a cluster model aimed at smart-home semantics; commissioning UX wrong for this product. Its *commissioning* semantics were adopted ([§12.3c](security.md#s12-3)).

**Design decisions.**

- **Why not SSE for telemetry:** [§1.1](foundations.md#s1-1).
- **Why not deltas on STATE:** loss becomes corruption; [§9.1](channels.md#s9-1).
- **Why not per-sample ACKs on motion input:** an ACK storm at 333 Hz, and the observable applied position is the meaningful confirmation anyway; [§9.3](channels.md#s9-3).
- **Why hybrid CBOR + packed structs:** exactly-one-encoding CBOR gives byte-exact vectors and canned templates for constrained clients; packed structs give a zero-cost hot path at 240–333 Hz. Pure CBOR taxes the hot path; pure protobuf taxes every client with a codegen toolchain and varint decode.
- **Why a pairing baseline rather than open or TLS-everywhere:** an open LAN made tier grants fiction on a product where unauthorized control is a safety issue; TLS costs tens of KB of RAM per session and has hostile self-signed-certificate UX on a LAN. HMAC-PIN plus knock-and-approve is the cheapest mechanism that makes "control" mean something (H3 bounds the claim).
- **Why the deadman forces no stop for a command-driven source, but defaults to `stop` for an autonomous one (RFC-045):** a command-driven source only ever moves because something told it to, so a silent one has nothing left to execute and settles on its own — forcing a latch on top of that manufactures a safety edge on a machine that was never out of control, and no value legal under the 250–5000 ms clamp survives a browser's background-tab timer throttle (~1 callback/minute) anyway, so treating the window as a hard safety deadline was never honest. A hub-autonomous generator is the different case: it is not a client's puppet, so its starter vanishing is not evidence it should stop — the conservative default is still `stop`, flippable per source to `continue` where a self-driving session surviving its starter's disconnect is wanted. [§11.3](safety.md#s11-3).
- **Why the readiness gate rather than buffering:** a hub knows it *sent* chunks, not that they *arrived* — true on TCP, false on a radio. And shipping undecodable frames into a client's bin wastes airtime. The gate is one flag and zero RAM. [§6.4](session.md#s6-4).
- **Why one code space for NACK and GOODBYE:** [§4.3](foundations.md#s4-3)'s unknown-code fallback is range-based, and two overlapping spaces make an unknown code unclassifiable. [§16.1](errors.md#s16-1).
- **Why `role` is a string and `category` is a number:** action roles carry a device-chosen suffix that no integer enum can express, while categories need a canonical cross-hub order that only a registered enum gives. [§8.8](catalog.md#s8-8).
- **Why `option_access` is schema-only:** a layout field is the read side; all write authorization flows through the paired INTENT channel. It also keeps the field map inside the depth-4 cap, which is already at its limit. [§8.8](catalog.md#s8-8).
- **Why stores are catalog entries rather than a parallel array:** a second top-level array would break the catalog root shape, the id sort, the etag computation and the per-entry depth rules — all four. [§8.7](catalog.md#s8-7).
- **Why the trust ledger is a store and not a packed roster:** a ledger entry does not fit a 242-byte snapshot at useful capacity; measurement put it at 2–7 entries depending on field set. [§12.6](security.md#s12-6).
- **Why signing is deferrable:** a software ECDSA on an accelerator-less controller is one uninterruptible tens-of-milliseconds call, and doing it inline would stall the hub's own tick for every connecting client. [§12.5](security.md#s12-5).
- **Why proof mode costs a round trip:** the shortcut that would have saved it (reusing the previous session's nonce) is replay-unsafe, and a successful replay *evicts the real client*. [§12.4](security.md#s12-4).
- **Why segments are non-decimable:** shedding's whole justification is that a dropped sample is recoverable by interpolation. For a timed command that is simply false. [§10.4](qos.md#s10-4).
- **Why `stream_kind` is registered rather than inferred:** the inference available was a free-form unit string, so two conforming hubs could shed differently under identical load. [§9.2](channels.md#s9-2).

## Appendix J — What changed since v1-draft *(informative)* {#appendix-j}

For implementers of the draft. This is a summary; the reasoning lives in `RFC-QUEUE.md`.

**Wire changes (breaking, permitted because the draft was never public):**

- CATALOG_REQ `0x09` / CATALOG_CHUNK `0x0A` **retired and burned**; chunked transfer generalized into BLOB_REQ `0x1A` / BLOB_CHUNK `0x1B` with the catalog as **namespace 0** ([§8.4](catalog.md#s8-4), [§8.7](catalog.md#s8-7)).
- New frames: PUBLISH `0x18`, CATALOG_READY `0x19`, AUTH `0x1C`, HUB_SIG `0x1D`.
- New global CBOR keys 37–43: `identity`, `blob`, `trust`, `body`, `intent_seq`, `burst`, `reboot_in_ms` — plus five scoped sub-key spaces, under the conservation rule of [§5.3](wire-format.md#s5-3).
- **EVENT kind-specific fields moved into `body` (40)**, keyed by the channel's own catalog schema.
- New channel class **STORE (4)**; new packed field types **`str16`/`str32`/`str64`** (8/9/10); new catalog entry keys `category`, `category_label`, `replay_depth`, `setting_channel`, `stream_kind`, `store`; the whole [§8.8](catalog.md#s8-8) annotation block on layout and schema fields, including schema-field `access` and `option_access`.
- Spec-core channels added: `log`, `session-admin`, `pending-pairing`, `pairing-events`, `paired-devices`, `paired-devices-roster`, `safety-events`. `session-roster` remains allocated and specified only — no reference catalog builder declares it ([§18](limitations.md#s18) item 17).
- New NACK/GOODBYE codes `DEADMAN_TIMEOUT`, `REBOOTING`, `READY_TIMEOUT`, `NOT_READY`; new safety cause `session_loss`; new safety ops `estop`, `override_on/off`, `bypass_on/off`.
- Per-binding `max_frame` defaults registered (the registry previously had none, so every binding invented one).

**Renames with unchanged wire values:** access tiers `viewer/controller/admin` → **`watch`/`control`/`configure`** (0/1/2).

**Behavioral changes:**

- The **dual-plane readiness gate** ([§6.4](session.md#s6-4)) — a session receives no data and may send no intents until it demonstrably holds the catalog.
- `cfg_gen` advances **iff an applied value actually changed**, in both directions ([§4.2-2](foundations.md#s4-2)).
- **Teardown equivalence** across all six session-end paths ([§6.9](session.md#s6-9)). At this base rewrite, `session_loss` was still distinguished from `deadman` as a latch cause; RFC-045 later retired that distinction entirely for source-loss ([§6.9](session.md#s6-9), [§11.3](safety.md#s11-3)) — neither cause latches anything on the reference hub today.
- **Blob transfer is paced and backpressure-respecting** ([§8.4](catalog.md#s8-4)): a refused write is retried at the same index rather than dropped, and a hub bounds how many chunks one transfer emits per service tick. Found in the field — the device catalog delivered 47 of 57 chunks against a 32-deep TX queue because the transfer discarded transport refusals.
- Idle reaping promoted from MAY to SHOULD with a registered multiplier ([§6.6](session.md#s6-6)).
- The [§10.4](qos.md#s10-4) shedding table is normative, with the **segment exception**.
- Safety: the hub latches all four levels; `stop`/`estop` are role-exempt; override/bypass join the safety snapshot.
- **[§12.2](security.md#s12-2)'s "admin only via the hub's own UI" is struck** — `configure` is obtainable by ceremony, which makes the administration surface pairing-reachable by design.
- Segment scheduling semantics for `t_base` ([§5.4](wire-format.md#s5-4)) and `max_future_schedule_ms`.
- Parser totality ([§5.8](wire-format.md#s5-8)) and the fuzz gate ([§17.4](conformance.md#s17-4)) became conformance obligations for **both** roles.

**Rejected, numbers retained:** a separate stored-vs-effective field flag, and a reserved `machine-limits` channel id — both **superseded by the [§8.8](catalog.md#s8-8) mechanism**, where `setting_key` presence answers the first and `field_roles` answers the second, so the registry never grows two ways to express one thing.

**Fixture re-freeze:** the conformance mini-catalog is now **775 bytes** with etag **`F4 A2 8F BB 58 CE D1 6A`** (was 733 / `21 CB 26 C9 4F B3 88 B5`), re-frozen at this tag ([§17.2](conformance.md#s17-2)).
