# 11. Safety *(normative)* {#s11}

## 11.1 The stop taxonomy and the safety snapshot {#s11-1}

Four distinct levels, all latched or gated in the `safety` STATE channel, all initiable via the `safety-intents` INTENT channel:

| Level | Meaning | Motion behavior | Clears by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ESTOP** | Emergency stop, latched | Immediate driver-level stop; motion prohibited while latched | Explicit authorized clear ([§11.2](#s11-2)) |
| **STOP** | Controlled stop | Decelerate to zero at configured decel; source deactivated | Any new accepted motion intent from an authorized source |
| **HOLD** | Position hold | Decelerate, then actively hold position; source suspended | RESUME by an authorized session |
| **PAUSE** | Generator pause | The hub-autonomous generator suspends at a safe phase; position parked | RESUME |

**The hub latches all four levels.** Delegate/application acceptance is what triggers the latch; a hub whose application does not implement a level MUST NACK `UNSUPPORTED_OP` and latch **nothing**. That is discoverable and honest — without it, a generic client could not know whether sending HOLD to an arbitrary hub did anything at all.

The `safety` snapshot carries: the active level bits, `cause` (a `safety_causes` value: `user`/`deadman`/`fault`/`relay`/`session_loss`), the initiating `origin` tier, the owning `session_id` where applicable, `estop_seq`, and an appended **modes** bitfield carrying `manual_override` and `bypass_limits`.

**Override and bypass are safety-domain state.** They are written by `safety-intents` ops (`override_on`/`override_off`/`bypass_on`/`bypass_off`, all `control`) and read from the safety snapshot. They typically render near a machine's manual controls, but they are safety state and other surfaces need them; putting them anywhere else would have made "what is currently bypassed" a per-UI secret. A per-move bypass flag on a motion intent, where a hub offers one, is a separate and unaffected thing.

They are latched **modes**, not stop edges, and deliberately have no event kind: giving them one would imply an operator action that a hub-side reconciliation (an e-stop dropping override as a side effect) did not have.

## 11.2 ESTOP end-to-end {#s11-2}

- **Initiation:** any endpoint, any tier, any session state — including *no* session (a paired relay may originate). **Safety outranks authorization by design: you may always stop the machine; you may not always start it.**
- **Two initiation paths, one behavior:**
  1. the raw **ESTOP frame** ([§5.5](wire-format.md#s5-5)) — the deframed-path and relay guarantee, recognizable by a byte scanner without a session;
  2. the **`estop` op** on the `safety-intents` channel — the trivially-implementable client path. A hub MUST treat it **exactly as a valid ESTOP frame**: same latch, `cause = user`, same publish, same edge event. Implementations SHOULD dispatch it through the same function as the frame path, so that "exactly as" is true by construction rather than by a parallel implementation.
  Without path 2, a client's red button silently degrades to a decel-stop — a ground-truth violation on a machine where the difference matters.
- **Latch is the acknowledgment.** The initiator MUST repeat its ESTOP every `estop_repeat_interval_ms` (50 ms), up to `estop_repeat_max` (20), until it observes `safety` STATE with the ESTOP bit latched and `estop_seq ≥ ` its sent seq — or exhausts retries and surfaces a **loud local failure**. There is no ESTOP-ACK frame; the observable latch is the only acknowledgment that means anything. All repeats of one initiation carry the same `estop_seq` ([§5.5](wire-format.md#s5-5)).
- **Hub obligations:** on first valid ESTOP (CRC-checked), stop motion via the driver's e-stop path **before** any protocol bookkeeping; latch; publish `safety` STATE at critical priority to all subscribers; emit the `estop_latched` edge on the safety-events channel.
- **Relay obligation:** forward ESTOP ahead of all buffered traffic, immediately, on all attached segments ([§14.2](transports.md#s14-2)) — including *upstream* if relay-originated.
- **HONESTY CLAUSE (H2) — preemption scope.** "Jumps the queue" is a **per-hop** guarantee: each hop's transmit queue admits ESTOP at the front. It is not magic end-to-end latency — TCP bytes already in flight ahead of it still drain first. Worst-case added latency per binding is declared in [§13.1](transports.md#s13-1).
- **HONESTY CLAUSE (H1).** The **hardware** e-stop path remains the guarantee of last resort. Valence's ESTOP is a software convenience layered above it and MUST NOT be presented to a user as a substitute for it.
- **Clearing:** the `estop_clear` op requires `control`; the hub MUST refuse with `CLEAR_REFUSED` unless (a) the latched cause is resolved (deadman: the lost source is confirmed detached or re-owned; fault: the fault flag is gone), (b) motion is at zero velocity, and (c) no other stop level is pending escalation. **Clearing never restarts motion** — it only re-arms the ability to start. The `estop_cleared` edge says the latch is gone, never that the machine moved.
- **A hub MUST NOT let a catalog authoring error widen safety authorization.** The `control` floor on `estop_clear` (and on any op whose effect is to re-arm motion) is a hub obligation independent of what the hub's own catalog declares about it. The catalog is the *discovery* surface for per-op access; it is not the only enforcement point for the ops that can start a machine moving again.

## 11.3 Deadman {#s11-3}

The deadman binds to the **active motion source**, not to sessions in general ([§6.6](session.md#s6-6) gives the other regime).

- Every session that owns an active source has a deadman window: `deadman_ms`, default 600, clamped to `[deadman_min_ms, deadman_max_ms]` = 250–5000, negotiated at WELCOME. Silence beyond the window — no frame of any kind, [§6.6](session.md#s6-6) — fires the deadman.
- **The window is negotiable.** HELLO MAY carry `deadman_wish_ms` (44). The hub clamps the wish into `[deadman_min_ms, deadman_max_ms]` — a hub MAY clamp tighter — and the APPLIED value is echoed on WELCOME `deadman_ms` (24), which was already the echo: post-clamp ground truth, zero new response plumbing. It exists because browsers throttle background-tab timers: a client that *knows* its liveness cadence is coarse could not previously ask for a window it can actually honor, and either hacked around eviction or flooded PINGs.
- **RFC-045: the deadman is liveness bookkeeping. It forces no stop, on any source class.** The session that owned the source is torn down exactly as any other teardown ([§6.9](session.md#s6-9)) and the source's ownership is released, unconditionally, so another authorized session may claim it — but *what happens to motion* is decided per source class, never by the deadman itself:
  - **Command-driven sources** (a motion stream, a manual jog, a live remote) latch **nothing**: no STOP, no safety-word bit, no `cause=deadman` entry in the `safety` snapshot. The machine only ever moves because something commanded it ([§9.6](channels.md#s9-6)'s closed motion surface: every mode is either a continuously-fed stream or an individually time-bounded segment), so a silent source has nothing left to execute — the last accepted command already runs out and the machine settles to rest with no further input required. A silent client is, by construction, not commanding motion; forcing a STOP on top of that converts an unremarkable absence of new commands into a manufactured, operator-visible safety edge for a machine that was never out of control.
  - **Hub-autonomous sources** (a pattern generator running on the hub, or any future on-hub script/scene player) are the one real exception, because for these "the client that pressed start went quiet" genuinely does not imply "motion should stop" — the generator runs *on the hub*. Behavior here is an explicit, catalog-declared per-source setting carrying the registered field role **`source.background_run`** (bool, RFC-048; registry `field_roles` — promoted from this RFC's original unregistered `on_disconnect: stop | continue` framing so a generic client can find the control on *any* hub without hardcoding its channel, the same upgrade `command.*` and `plan.*` already got). Rendered through the ordinary settings metamodel ([§8.8](catalog.md#s8-8)) — this remains device-declared data, not a new protocol frame. **`false` is the default** (conservative, hub-flippable): the generator stops. `true` leaves the generator running in the background, unowned, reachable at any moment by the role-exempt `stop`/`estop` ops ([§11.2](#s11-2)) from **any** connected session including a bare `watch` viewer. **Phase D correction:** an earlier draft of this text said the `false` case latches STOP with `cause = deadman`. It does not, and MUST NOT: the library stays generic here exactly as it does for a command-driven source — `Hub::releaseSessionSources()` only ever calls `onSourceOwnership(source, 0, reason)`, latching nothing, for every source class alike. Whether and how to stop calling into the generator is entirely the FIRMWARE DELEGATE's decision inside that one hook, symmetric with a command-driven source settling with no safety edge: an autonomous generator that stops being driven is, in the same sense, "already stopped" — manufacturing a safety-word edge for it would be the identical mistake [§11.3](#s11-3)'s own "why this changed" note already rejects for streams. A hub wanting an operator-visible edge for this case MAY still publish one through its own STATE/EVENT surface; the protocol does not manufacture it. Streaming sources are explicitly out of scope for this role — a dead stream leaves the machine still by construction (SETTLE, above), so no switch exists or is wanted for them; continuation only ever needs an explicit, visible choice where a live source keeps generating its own motion. Rendering rules (placement, confirm-gating, the unattended-and-moving indicator) are normative in `RENDERING.md` §10.1. The recourse for autonomous motion was never "wait for its owner" — it was always "anyone in the room can stop it."
  - Ownership release is **unconditional** either way ([§11.4](#s11-4)) — that half of the deadman's job is unchanged.
- **Legacy edges get synthetic sessions with equivalent timeouts** ([§15.1](legacy.md#s15-1)). There is **no unmonitored path to motion** — releasing ownership on silence, unconditionally, is what makes that true; forcing a stop was never required to make it true.

*Why this changed (informative).* An earlier design forced a STOP latch on every command-driven deadman fire. Under a clocked interpolator that had a real job: a starved generator could plausibly keep commanding motion on its own. Under an intent-based planner — one command produces one bounded plan, and execution never invents motion between commands ([§9.6](channels.md#s9-6)) — that hazard does not exist: a plan that runs out of fresh input already settles to rest by construction, so the forced latch only ever converted a graceful settle into a spurious, operator-visible STOP edge (auto-cleared the moment a resuming stream's first bundle landed) on a machine that had never actually left the operator's control. Treating the window as a hard safety deadline was also never physically honest: browsers throttle a backgrounded tab's timers to roughly one callback per **minute**, so no value legal under the 250–5000 ms clamp could survive a locked screen, and a value fast enough to matter as a safety limit is far too fast to avoid punishing an operator who merely alt-tabbed. The deadman keeps its liveness job — slot/ownership bookkeeping, `control-owner` accuracy — and sheds the safety job it was never actually doing for command-driven sources.

## 11.4 Control arbitration {#s11-4}

A machine's arbiter assigns priorities *between source types*. Valence adds the layer an arbiter cannot provide: arbitration *within* a type.

- **The sole-caller rule is a protocol obligation.** Valence sessions submit intents to the machine's motion arbiter, which is the only component permitted to command the driver. A hub that lets any session reach the driver by another path is non-conformant.
- **Exclusive ownership.** Each source has at most one owning session at a time, published in the `control-owner` STATE channel. The first authorized session to activate a source owns it; a second session's activating intent gets NACK `SOURCE_CONFLICT`.
- **STREAM channels mapped to a source** participate on the same machinery: the **first accepted bundle** acquires the source, each subsequent accepted bundle refreshes the deadman window ([§6.6](session.md#s6-6): any received frame is proof of life), and a bundle from a non-owner while the source is owned is dropped — with the [§9.2](channels.md#s9-2) `SOURCE_CONFLICT` signal so the producer is not left guessing. Data-plane bundles carry no takeover flag; a would-be taker acquires through an intent.
- **TAKEOVER:** re-issuing the activating intent with `takeover: true` (32) transfers ownership if the requester's tier ≥ the owner's. The hub emits a takeover EVENT and a `control-owner` STATE update; the dispossessed session's UI MUST reflect loss of control immediately — it is subscribed to the same channel as everyone else, so this requires no message addressed to it. Takeover *between* source types remains the arbiter's existing priority logic, unchanged.
- **Release** happens on every teardown path identically ([§6.9](session.md#s6-9)), on deadman fire, and on an explicit release intent. **Post-deadman reacquisition requires a fresh activating intent** ([§6.8](session.md#s6-8)) — never a silent resume.
- **Tiers gate the door.** Activating any source requires `control`. A `watch` session cannot own a source, full stop — but it can still stop the machine ([§11.2](#s11-2)).

## 11.5 Invariants under partial failure {#s11-5}

Whatever dies — a client, a relay, a transport, the network — all of the following MUST hold:

1. Motion driven by a vanished command-driven source runs out of fresh commands and settles to rest on its own within its deadman window (RFC-045) — no protocol-forced stop is needed for this to hold, because [§9.6](channels.md#s9-6)'s closed motion surface bounds every mode a source can use.
2. The ESTOP latch, once set, survives every reconnect and is adopted by every arriving client **before it can act** — retained STATE plus the readiness gate ([§6.4](session.md#s6-4)) plus the LIVE gate ([§2.2](foundations.md#s2-2)) together guarantee this, which is why the readiness gate covers the intent plane and not only the data plane.
3. A relay's death makes its clients *silent*, which triggers the same deadman path as client death. The hub cannot distinguish them and does not need to.
4. No failure mode results in a client displaying motion as stopped while the machine moves, because displays render only adopted hub state and go visibly stale when the link dies.
5. Every session-end path releases ownership identically ([§6.9](session.md#s6-9)), so no departed session can hold a source hostage.
