# 8. Catalog *(normative)* {#s8}

The catalog is the hub's machine-readable self-description. It is the load-bearing artifact of the whole protocol: everything a generic client knows about a hub it learns here, and every "how does a client discover X" question in this document resolves to "the catalog says".

## 8.1 The channel entry {#s8-1}

The catalog is an array of channel entries. The **normative encoding is CDDL-defined** in [`schema/catalog.cddl`](schema.md) ([Appendix C](appendices.md#appendix-c)); this section is its prose companion and the CDDL wins on any disagreement.

An entry carries: `id` (u16), `name`, `class` (STATE/STREAM/INTENT/EVENT/STORE), `dir` (h2c/c2h), `access` (the **floor** tier required to subscribe, or for INTENT to send), `max_rate_hz` (f32; 0.0 = on-change only), `default_priority`, and **exactly one** of:

- `layout` — an ordered array of packed fields, for STATE and STREAM;
- `schema` — a map of integer key → field, for INTENT (the fields of `value`) and EVENT (the fields of `body`);
- `store` — a store descriptor, for STORE ([§8.7](#s8-7)).

Plus these optional entry-level keys:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `category` | `ui_categories` value (RFC-047/048, Phase C2); 1–14 registered, `0x40`–`0x7E` vendor/device-defined. Was `setting_categories` pre-Phase-C2 — same wire key, new vocabulary (pre-tag restructuring; see the registry tombstone). |
| `category_label` | REQUIRED iff `category` is in the vendor range (`0x40`–`0x7E`) |
| `replay_depth` | entries the hub MAY replay on grant — presence is **the** exception to [§9.4](channels.md#s9-4)'s no-replay rule |
| `setting_channel` | the u16 INTENT channel that writes this entry's setting-annotated fields; REQUIRED iff any field carries `setting_key` |
| `stream_kind` | `stream_kinds` value; STREAM class only; **absent means `samples` (0)** |

**Encoding structure rule.** The catalog on the wire is its outer array header followed by each entry encoded as an independent, self-delimiting document. Every entry document individually satisfies the [§5.3](wire-format.md#s5-3) depth-4 cap; decoders MAY — and depth-4 decoders MUST — process entries one at a time with per-entry decoder state. The etag ([§8.3](#s8-3)) is computed over exactly these concatenated bytes.

**Entry size bound.** A single encoded entry MUST NOT exceed `catalog_max_entry_bytes` (4096). A fully-annotated 50-field entry can encode to 8–10 KB, which would violate [§5.8](wire-format.md#s5-8)'s no-unbounded-allocation rule for a per-entry decode buffer. Oversize is a **catalog-authoring error** caught by conformance tooling, not a runtime surprise: the author splits the entry across channels or trims descriptions. Total entries are bounded by `catalog_max_entries` (256), a conformance floor rather than a wire cap.

**Depth budget, stated as a design constraint.** Counting from an entry map: `entry → layout array → field map → options array` = 4, at the cap; likewise `entry → layout → field → bits` and `entry → schema → field → options`. The leaves of those containers are scalars by construction. **Any future annotation that wants a map or array *inside* a field map is therefore blocked and must ride the entry level instead.** This is a real constraint, not a formality.

## 8.2 Schema language scope {#s8-2}

The layout/schema vocabulary is deliberately small: fixed-width numeric types and fixed-width strings (`packed_field_types`), a scale factor (wire = physical × scale), short unit strings (`mm`, `mm/s`, `mA`, `degC`, `%`, `count`, `flag`, ""), min/max, and the [§8.8](#s8-8) annotation block. It describes *values and their meaning*, not behavior and not appearance. Nesting, variable-length fields, and conditionals are out of scope by design; a channel that seems to need them is two channels.

## 8.3 Etag computation {#s8-3}

`catalog_etag` = the first `etag_bytes` (8) of SHA-256 over the catalog encoded in the [§5.3](wire-format.md#s5-3) deterministic profile, entries sorted ascending by `id`. Deterministic encoding makes the hash reproducible from the catalog *content* alone — any implementation, any language, same bytes, same etag.

The etag covers everything in [§8.1](#s8-1): ids, names, classes, directions, access, rates, priorities, layouts, schemas, store descriptors, and every annotation. It does **not** cover retained *values* — that is `cfg_gen`'s and seq's job.

Because the etag covers annotations, adding a tooltip changes it. That is correct and intended: a client caching by etag would otherwise render a stale label forever.

## 8.4 Transfer: the catalog is blob namespace 0 {#s8-4}

Chunked transfer is **one verb for the whole protocol** ([§8.7](#s8-7)). The catalog is simply blob namespace 0.

- **BLOB_REQ** (`0x1A`, c2h, CBOR): `blob` (38) selects what — for the catalog, `ns = 0` and no `store_id`/`slot`. An empty selection means "send everything"; `chunks` (27) at the top level makes it a **selective repair** request listing missing indices. **Grammar-level rejection (RFC-049e, stated precisely so a decoder has an actual rule to enforce rather than a state with no wire representation): a `chunks` array present but empty is MALFORMED and MUST be rejected** — an empty selection already means "send everything," so a decoder must never have to guess whether an empty `chunks` array is a degenerate repair request or a disguised full request. **A catalog-namespace (`ns = 0`) request carrying `store_id` or `slot` is likewise MALFORMED**, because the catalog is a singleton with no store or slot to select. (These replace an earlier, imprecise framing — "carrying both a full request and `chunks` is MALFORMED" — that named an illegal state with no independent encoding: "full" is *defined* as the absence of `chunks`, so there was never a distinct wire shape to reject. See [§18-9](limitations.md#s18).)
- **BLOB_CHUNK** (`0x1B`, h2c, raw): a fixed header naming the same identity fields as `blob_keys` (namespace, store, slot, generation, `chunk_index`, `chunk_count`, `total_bytes`), followed by up to `catalog_chunk_payload` (192) bytes of the deterministic encoding. 192 fits every binding unfragmented; WS MAY carry multiple chunks back-to-back.
- The receiver reassembles by index, requests missing indices after `catalog_chunk_gap_timeout_ms` (500 ms, SHOULD), and abandons after `frag_reassembly_timeout_ms` (5 s) total — then either retries from scratch or falls back to the static profile ([§8.5](#s8-5)). `total_bytes` lets a receiver size or refuse a transfer **before** assembling it ([§5.8-1](wire-format.md#s5-8)). A receiver that refuses — declared size over its reassembly budget — MUST say so: GOODBYE `BLOB_REFUSED` ([§4.5](foundations.md#s4-5)), never a half-session idling toward `READY_TIMEOUT`; hubs SHOULD log the declared size alongside it.
- **A hub MAY pace chunk emission, and MUST respect transport backpressure while doing so.** [§13.1](transports.md#s13-1) defines a transport refusal as "not accepted right now; the caller decides retry vs drop" — for BLOB_CHUNK the hub **MUST retry**, resuming at the refused index, and MUST NOT treat the refusal as an error (no NACK, no teardown). A hub that instead emits every chunk in one synchronous burst and discards refusals silently truncates any blob longer than the binding's egress queue; that is non-conformant, and it fails invisibly because the sender sees a completed loop. Correspondingly, a **receiver MUST NOT assume a transfer arrives in one delivery**: it is bounded by `catalog_chunk_gap_timeout_ms` between chunks and `frag_reassembly_timeout_ms` overall, and by nothing else. **The backpressure decision is table-driven** (RFC-050, reapplying [§10.4](qos.md#s10-4)'s pattern to this gap): pacing granularity itself stays a hub policy and is not on the wire, but the *response* to a binding's own [§13.1](transports.md#s13-1) congestion signal is normative, not a hub-invented policy:

  | # | Binding congestion signal ([§10.3](qos.md#s10-3)) | Decision |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1 | clear, or in-flight chunks < `blob_chunks_in_flight` | **Send** the next chunk |
  | 2 | congested, in-flight chunks = `blob_chunks_in_flight` | **Hold** emission at the current index |
  | 3 | congested → recovered ([§10.3](qos.md#s10-3) thresholds) before the row-4 abort fires | **Resume** emission from the held index |
  | 4 | congested, **sustained > 5 s** ([§10.3](qos.md#s10-3)'s own sustained-congestion window) | **Abort** the transfer: one NACK `BUSY` carrying `retry_after_ms`, per the existing "one NACK answers one BLOB_REQ" rule below — never a NACK per chunk |

  `blob_chunks_in_flight` (registry `limits`, default 4) is the concrete, binding-independent number the panel's "what IS the signal" finding asked for: a hub MAY advertise less, MUST NOT advertise more, and a chunk the receiver has not yet acknowledged by reassembly progress counts against it. This closes the gap between an advisory "MAY pace" and an implementer actually knowing what to code against.

  ```

  *The `Send ⟲ Check` loop is the ordinary case — most transfers never touch
  `Hold`. `Abort` fires once per stalled transfer, never once per chunk.*
- **BLOB_DONE (`0x20`) is the transfer's positive completion signal**, generalizing CATALOG_READY's pattern ([§6.4](session.md#s6-4)) rather than adding a second concept: the **receiver** of a transfer — the client for the common hub→client case, the hub for a client→hub STORE import ([§8.7](#s8-7)) — MUST send BLOB_DONE once reassembly concludes, carrying the same identity fields as `blob_keys` (namespace, store_id, slot, generation) plus `status` (0 verified-complete after a local hash check succeeds, 1 hash-mismatch, 2 aborted — e.g. by row 4 above, or by the receiver's own `frag_reassembly_timeout_ms` giving up). It is idempotent, exactly like CATALOG_READY: safe to re-send on a duplicate delivery or a retried reassembly. **The sender treats a nonzero `status` per its own retry policy** — BLOB_DONE reports an outcome, it does not itself request a retry; a sender wanting one re-issues the transfer as a fresh BLOB_REQ. A receiver that never verifies (a static client, or one that trusts transport-level integrity) MAY omit BLOB_DONE; nothing upstream of the catalog namespace blocks on it, so its absence degrades observability, not correctness.
- A hub bounds concurrent transfers by its RAM; beyond that, BLOB_REQ gets NACK `BUSY`. **A `blob.ns` value outside the registered `blob_namespaces` table (and outside the device-defined 128–255 range) MUST be rejected with NACK `INVALID_NAMESPACE`** (RFC-049e) — a namespace that does not exist at all is a different failure from a store or slot that does not exist *within* a namespace that does, and a client needs to tell them apart to know whether retrying with a different `store_id`/`slot` could ever succeed. A request naming a store or slot that does not exist within a valid namespace gets NACK `CHUNK_UNAVAILABLE`, unchanged. **One NACK answers one BLOB_REQ**, whether the request was refused up front, a resumed transfer became unservable partway (the addressed item was deleted, resized, or its `generation` moved), or the sender aborted it per row 4 above — never one per bad index and never one per chunk.
- The hub MUST gate BLOB_REQ on the declaring entry's `access` exactly as it gates SUBSCRIBE.

**Only the catalog namespace has a readiness concept** ([§6.4](session.md#s6-4)). You cannot decode STATE without the catalog; nothing gates on a preset.

## 8.5 The static-client profile (etag-pinned) {#s8-5}

A constrained client MAY ship with a **compiled-in catalog** and pre-encoded CBOR templates instead of a CBOR stack. Requirements:

- It sends its compiled-in etag in HELLO. If the hub's etag matches: full speed ahead, ready immediately.
- On mismatch it MUST choose a **declared** behavior: **(a)** proceed **degraded** — the [§5.4](wire-format.md#s5-4) append-only rule guarantees its known prefix of every layout still parses; it MUST suppress any *control* function whose schema it cannot re-verify; or **(b)** refuse with a user-visible "update me" indication. **Silent full operation on a mismatched etag is non-conformant.**
- A degraded client sends CATALOG_READY with its stale etag ([§6.4](session.md#s6-4)).
- The hub treats static clients identically to dynamic ones; the profile is client-internal except for the etag check. NACK `ETAG_MISMATCH` exists for hubs configured to refuse degraded operation outright — a hub policy, not the default.

## 8.6 Catalog invariance and mid-session change {#s8-6}

The catalog is **client-invariant**: every session sees the same entries and the same etag. Access control acts at SUBSCRIBE/PUBLISH/INTENT/BLOB_REQ time (NACK `ACCESS_DENIED`), **never** by filtering the catalog. Per-client catalogs would fracture etag caching and static profiles, and would make a generic renderer's "gray, never hide" rule ([§8.9](#s8-9)) impossible to honor.

**Settings are fixed per firmware.** The set of channels and fields is enumerated at connect and is never created or destroyed at runtime. A change is a catalog change, which changes the etag, which is already the resync trigger. Mid-session catalog change is signaled by the `catalog` channel's STATE update ([§4.2-3](foundations.md#s4-2)); clients re-enter SYNCING.

## 8.7 STORE channels and the blob verb {#s8-7}

A **STORE**-class catalog entry declares a collection of slot-addressed items: `{store_id, kind, capacity, per_item_max, name_max}`. `kind` is a namespaced string (e.g. `"pattern.frayd"`, `"trust.ledger"`). Presets, saved positions, limit profiles, recordings and the trust ledger are all the same machinery.

- **Why an ordinary catalog entry:** a parallel top-level array would break the catalog root shape, the id sort, the etag computation and the per-entry depth rules — all four.
- **The dynamic half is a separate tiny STATE channel** carrying `{generation, count, capacity}`, on-change and retained. A generation bump means "re-enumerate". This keeps the catalog invariant per firmware ([§8.6](#s8-6)) while the roster changes freely. Every store in the protocol is this pair of entries.
- **Items** are `{slot, name, kind, payload}` and move over BLOB_REQ/BLOB_CHUNK with `ns = 1 (store)`, `store_id` selecting the store and `slot` the item.
- **`payload` is OPAQUE.** The protocol layer never decodes it, and [§5.8](wire-format.md#s5-8)'s depth and allocation budget explicitly does not extend inside it. A client that decodes a preset has stepped above the protocol boundary.
- **CRUD rides INTENT** on a device-declared channel: `save` (the hub captures **current live state** by default; a client MAY supply a `payload`, which is an *import*), `load` (the hub applies; the resulting truth arrives via the normal STATE broadcasts — ground truth, no special echo), `delete`, `rename`. The hub validates `kind` and size on import and NACKs `INVALID_VALUE`; it never inspects the payload.
- **Caps are hub-declared with generous spec floors:** `capacity ≥ preset_capacity_min` (32) as a conformance floor, `per_item_max` defaulting to `preset_item_max_bytes` (4096). Small hubs declare less and the catalog says so.

**The one carve-out.** The store whose `kind` is `"trust.ledger"` has a **registered item grammar** (`trust_ledger_keys`, [§12.6](security.md#s12-6)). Presets are device content and are genuinely opaque; the trust ledger is *protocol* content whose fields this document names, which every `configure` client must render and act on, and where "revoke device 3" has to mean the same thing on every hub. The store *machinery* is reused verbatim — chunking, repair, generation, caps, all free — and only this one store's payload grammar is agreed centrally. Opacity is the default and stays the default.

## 8.8 The settings metamodel *(the annotation block)* {#s8-8}

Every layout and schema field MAY carry an annotation block. **All of it is optional and all of it is ignorable**: a client that reads none of it behaves exactly as a v1-draft client did. A client that reads it can build its entire settings and control surface from the hub — a control added in firmware populates on every client's next connect, with its label, grouping, units, constraints and explanation coming from the machine rather than from each client developer's guesswork.

| Annotation | Applies to | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `setting_key` | layout fields | the CBOR key in the entry's `setting_channel` that **writes** this field. **Present = this field is a setting (stored config): adopt it into a control. Absent = read-only** (effective state or telemetry): display it, and **never** write it back into a setting's shadow |
| `default` | both | the factory value, same type as the field |
| `options` | both | labels for a single-select; **the wire value is the array index** |
| `group` | both | a free-form card heading within the category tab |
| `desc` | both | user-facing description, ≤ `desc_max_bytes` (128). Flash-resident on the hub, travels once, etag-cached |
| `role` | both | a `field_roles` string — see below |
| `step` | both | range granularity hint |
| `flags` | both | `setting_flags` bitmask: `advanced`, `restart_required`, `secret` |
| `access` | **schema fields only** | per-**op** minimum tier; overrides the entry's `access` floor upward or downward |
| `option_access` | **schema fields only** | per-**option** minimum tier, index-aligned with `options` |

**`setting_key` presence is the stored-vs-effective distinction**, and it needs no separate flag. A machine's stroke window may lawfully report a *stored* configured value on the write plane and a different *effective* value on the state plane — on an unhomed machine, for example, stored `[5, 495]` and effective `[0, max_rail]` are both true. A client that adopts the effective value into the stored control stomps operator input; the presence test is what tells it not to.

**`access` and `option_access` are schema-field annotations only.** A layout field is the **read** side — a STATE snapshot value — and *all* write authorization flows through the paired INTENT channel named by `setting_channel` + `setting_key`. A client needing per-option gating resolves that join (which it must do anyway to encode a write) and reads `option_access` on the schema field there. This also keeps the field map inside the depth-4 cap, which is already at its limit.

`option_access` exists because an op-style INTENT carries its verb as one **enum-valued field** — the safety-intents channel does exactly this — and per-*field* access cannot vary across the values of one field. Without it, the role-exempt safety ops ([§11.2](safety.md#s11-2)) would force their whole channel down to `watch` access, and a generic renderer would then offer hold/pause/takeover to every watcher, discovering otherwise only by NACK. That violates gray-never-hide.

**Field roles** are the semantic vocabulary that lets a client find a thing on *any* hub without hardcoding a channel number: `limit.user.speed`, `limit.input.jerk`, `window.min`, `telemetry.position`, `identity.name`, `meta.enabled_mask`, `meta.reset_gen`, and so on (registry `field_roles`). Two conventions rather than entries: `<role>.peak` is the peak companion of any telemetry role, and `action.<name>` marks a schema field as a **verb** rather than a value ([§9.3](channels.md#s9-3)).

`role` is a **string**, not a number, because `action.<name>` carries a device-chosen suffix no integer enum could express. Unregistered roles are legal. **Nothing is hardcoded as a requirement; roles are hardcoded as opportunities.** A client that recognizes a registered role MAY upgrade to a bespoke widget; a client that does not MUST fall back to generic rendering. Fallback is mandatory, upgrades are optional, an unknown role is never an error.

Three role families were registered by the first generic clients, which found the holes by refusing to guess:

- **`command.<quantity>`** names a value-bearing INTENT field whose value **is** the setpoint; `command.position` (a commanded absolute target position, in the channel's own unit) is the first member. It is deliberately distinct from `action.*`, which marks **verbs**: tagging a move's `position` field as an action would tell every generic client to draw a button where a positional control belongs. A command role generally pairs with a `telemetry.*` counterpart.
- **`telemetry.target`** is the position the machine is currently *commanded* to, as opposed to `telemetry.position`, where it measurably is. Lag is deliberately **not** a role: it is `target − position`, computed client-side — registering a third field for a subtraction would invite two sources of truth for one number.
- **`plan.*`** names motion-plan telemetry, the segment in flight: `plan.start`, `plan.end`, `plan.current`, `plan.velocity`, `plan.elapsed`, `plan.duration`, `plan.style`. The inclusion test is "would a *different* machine's motion planner have this concept?" — the same test that keeps device internals out of `pattern.*`.

**Role cardinality.** A registered role SHOULD appear on at most one field per catalog. A client that meets duplicates binds the **first in catalog order** — a deterministic, conformant tiebreak rather than a client-local guess.

**Categories** organize the surface. Entry-level `category` carries a `ui_categories` id (RFC-047/048, Phase C2; the fourteen-value navigation vocabulary of RENDERING.md §3, replacing the retired `setting_categories`): ids 1–14 are spec-registered with a canonical registry order so placement, iconography and translation are consistent across every hub a client ever meets; `0x40`–`0x7E` are device-defined, MUST carry `category_label`, and render as additional tabs after the spec set. **A category spans channels** — two channels in the same category merge into one tab, which is the answer to a category outgrowing one 242-byte snapshot (about 58 f32 or 115 u16 fields, inclusive of mask bytes).

**Dynamic enablement.** "Grayed out right now" depends on live machine state and therefore cannot live in static metadata at all. A settings STATE channel carries one or more `bitfield8` fields tagged `meta.enabled_mask`; bit *i* gates the *i*-th setting-annotated field of that layout. On-change, retained, conflated — every client grays from the same ground truth.

**Secrets (normative).** A `secret`-flagged field's value **NEVER** appears in STATE. The snapshot carries only a set/unset presence bit. Writes ride the paired INTENT normally, and ECHO confirms application **without echoing the value**. A WiFi password must never ride a retained snapshot that open-access `watch` sessions receive. A secret *string* SHOULD be `str16` or write-only with a presence bit: a `secret str32` burns 13 % of a snapshot to communicate one bit.

**Validation is hub-side.** `min`/`max`/`step`/width are UI hints; the hub is the referee and NACKs `INVALID_VALUE`. There is **no regex requirement on clients** — an optional pattern hint MAY be included and MAY be ignored. A constrained client must never need a regex engine to render a settings page.

**Applied values stay inside advertised ranges.** An ECHO `applied` value, and the value of any `setting_key`-bearing field, MUST lie within that field's declared `min`/`max`. A hub whose internal clamp can exceed its advertised range MUST widen the advertised range, not lie past it — generic renderers depend on it. Read-only *effective* fields lawfully exceed a paired setting's range and declare their own display bounds; that is not a violation, it is the stored-vs-effective distinction doing its job.

## 8.9 Normative rendering checklist *(what a compliant client library means)* {#s8-9}

This is spec text, not wire. A client claiming generic-settings support MUST:

1. build tabs from the spec categories present, in registry order, then device categories by id using their `category_label`;
2. build cards from `group` strings in authoring order; ungrouped fields go to a default card;
3. choose the widget from **type + constraints, never from a hint** — there is no widget field, deliberately: `bool`/u8→toggle, u8 + `options`→select, `bitfield8`→checkbox group, numeric + min/max→slider or numeric entry, `str<N>`→text, **no `setting_key`→read-only display with unit**;
4. order presentation as **authoring order**: tabs in registry order then device ids; within a tab, channels ascending by id and fields in layout order. No ordering metadata is carried on the wire;
5. render a disabled field **gray, never hidden**;
6. surface `desc` through a help affordance appropriate to the form factor;
7. show writes as **pending until ECHO**, and display **applied** values only ([§1.2-1](foundations.md#s1-2) restated for settings);
8. render an unknown role, flag, category, or annotation key **generically** — fallback is mandatory.

A phone renders a range as a slider, a remote as a click-wheel value, a plugin side panel as a numeric box. Same bytes, three honest UIs.

**Index 0 of an op table is never an operation.** For a `schema` select field carrying an `action.*` role, wire value 0 is NOT an operation unless the governing op table registers an op at 0 — registry op tables number from 1, so index 0 exists only to keep `options` array-index-aligned and carries a filler label. Clients MUST NOT render index 0 as an actionable choice. Gating index 0 with `option_access` at a high tier remains RECOMMENDED defense-in-depth, but cannot be the whole answer: `AccessLevel` tops out at `configure`, which real admin sessions actually hold, so there is no "level nobody holds" to gate with — the rendering rule is what closes it.
