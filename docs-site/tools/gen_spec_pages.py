"""Generate the documentation site's Specification tier from the normative
source document.

    <spec_path>     spec/SPEC.md               the normative spec
    <traces_path>   spec/examples/session-traces.md   Appendix E
    <cddl_path>     spec/schema/catalog.cddl   Appendix C, the catalog schema

Usage:
    python docs-site/tools/gen_spec_pages.py          # (re)write generated files
    python docs-site/tools/gen_spec_pages.py --check  # exit 1 if any file is stale
    python docs-site/tools/gen_spec_pages.py --list   # print the generated file list
    python docs-site/tools/gen_spec_pages.py --nav    # print the mkdocs.yml nav block
    python docs-site/tools/gen_spec_pages.py --spec PATH   # override the source

WHY THIS EXISTS
    A hand-copied specification is the worst kind of hand-copied constant,
    because an implementer trusts a specification absolutely and does not
    compile it. This project has already shipped the copy-drift bug four
    times: a stale JS intent-schema table that encoded a float as an int, a
    hand-rolled EstopCause enum, a hardcoded WebUI layout table that truncated
    a telemetry field, and a mermaid-vendoring caveat. A second copy of the
    normative text would beat all four.

    So there is no second copy. SPEC.md is the source; these pages are a
    build product; `--check` fails the build the moment they disagree.

    This is the specification sibling of tools/gen_docs_tables.py, which does
    the same job for the registry tables. The two scripts deliberately do not
    import each other: different sources of truth, different output grammars,
    and each must stay independently editable. They share conventions only —
    same config file, same `--check` semantics, same banner.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT IS ALLOWED TO CHANGE
    Normative text is copied VERBATIM. The only transformations are:

    1. heading levels shift by page, and every heading gains an explicit,
       number-derived anchor (§6.4 -> `#s6-4`, Appendix G -> `#appendix-g`);
    2. `§n.m` cross-references become links to wherever that clause landed
       after the split (this is the whole difficulty of splitting a
       cross-referenced document, so it is checked: an unresolvable reference
       is a hard error, and every emitted link is anchor-validated by
       `mkdocs build --strict`);
    3. repo-relative links (`registry/registry.yaml`, `RFC-QUEUE.md`, ...) are
       resolved against SOURCE_LINKS: published companions become site links,
       unpublished ones degrade to their own link text. An unlisted target is
       a hard error, so a new link in SPEC.md cannot silently rot;
    4. front matter, the DO-NOT-EDIT banner, page titles, and clearly-marked
       site notes are added around the text.

    No word of the normative register is rewritten, summarized or reordered.

# ==========================================================================
# THE SPLIT
#
# 1544 lines on one page is hostile to reading, to the browser's find, and to
# deep-linking. The grouping below is BY CONCERN, and every group is a thing
# an implementer works on in one sitting:
#
#   - Foundations   (1-4)  everything you must agree on before a byte moves:
#                          scope, the words, the shape, the compatibility
#                          contract. Short sections that are only read once.
#   - one page per  (5-13, 15-18) the load-bearing layers. Each is cited
#     major layer          heavily and deserves its own URL and its own TOC.
#   - Transports    (13-14) the relay is a forwarding role defined entirely in
#                          terms of the binding matrix above it; splitting
#                          them would put §14.3's timestamp rules on a page
#                          that never states the MTUs they are bounded by.
#   - Appendices    (A-G)  the lookup material: tables, schema, worked sketch,
#                          vector index. Kept together because a reader
#                          consulting one usually consults its neighbor.
#   - Rationale     (H-J)  the informative history: rejected alternatives, the
#                          gap-closure audit, the draft delta. Long, read once,
#                          and never during implementation. Its own page keeps
#                          it out of the lookup material's way.
#   - Traces               Appendix E's content, which lives in its own source
#                          file and is a narrative, not a clause.
#   - Schema               Appendix C's content: the catalog CDDL, which lives
#                          in its own source file and is NORMATIVE — it wins
#                          over §8.1's prose on any disagreement. A normative
#                          artifact that the site rendered as un-linkable
#                          inline code was the one remaining place a reader
#                          could be sent to a file this site does not carry.
#
# Every section number in SPEC.md MUST be claimed by exactly one page below.
# A new §19 therefore FAILS this generator until someone decides where it is
# published — the same discipline gen_docs_tables.py applies to registry
# sections, for the same reason.
